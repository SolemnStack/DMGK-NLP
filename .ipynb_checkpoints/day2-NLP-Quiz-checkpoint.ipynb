In an entire year, they invited us to 2 events total, not even necessarily holidays. Not only that, but they always treat my fiance as the black sheep of the family. When he was younger, his mom gave his dad an ultimatum and they ended up sending him to a private school.\\n\\nSince our baby's birth, his parents have been wanting to spend time with her. I don't mind. I let them have their time with her and she even gets to spend the night with her grandparents if they so choose.\\n\\nHowever, they don't necessarily attempt to make my fiance and I feel welcome. They will make small talk, but other than that, it feels as though they want us to leave so they can have their time with the baby.\\n\\nOn top of that, whenever I suggest something for them to do with her, they always act like it's wrong. Our baby has to go to physical therapy for a common tight muscle issue and they've given us exercises to do with her to stretch it out and make it stronger. I showed his parents the exercises and they said that even just going to PT is a waste of time. Needless to say, they haven't done any of the exercises. They refuse to do tummy time because they think it's bs. Our pediatrician even recommended a special juice for her as her digestive cycle is a little backed up. I sent some juice with them and it came back untouched. They said they wouldn't give it to her because it will rot her teeth (she doesn't even have any teeth yet!).\\n\\nIt just hurts my feelings and I feel like my wishes for my child's best interest are being walked all over. Other than letting them watch her once a week, I don't necessarily want anything else to do with them.\\n\\nAITA?\\n\\nOr WIBTA if I told my fiance about this?

I calmed him and served him his food. Some minutes later, a mom sat next to us with 3 kids, the youngest being almost the same age as my youngest nephew.  \\n\\nSo, the other kid began to throw a tantrum quite similar to the one my nephew did.

Usually I leave when a little sh*t like this acts out!\\n\\nI was so mad and could see the desesperate mom trying to pull her child and calm him. I told my sister not to say that three times but she kept saying it louder. Every one was giving her the stink eye. I finally told her that I didn't like how she was acting and would leave if she continued. She did so I left. I kissed my nephew who were playing in the games area and went home with my car ( she had her own too). She went home some time later I guess.\\n\\nI am here because now my sister and my mother are telling me that and overreacted.

I’m on mobile so sorry for formatting nonsense. This is kind of a difficult situation with a lot of emotion and history outside of what I’ll say so I’m going to try to keep it simple and to the point. My mom has been with this guy, I’ll call him Derek, for 11 years. They aren’t married because my mom isn’t much a fan of marriage, hence quotes around step-father. He met me when I was 13. My childhood was difficult and I didn’t like him almost right away and I’ll admit that I’m still not his biggest fan. \\n\\nAnyway, I’ve always struggled with really bad mental health issues. Suicidal thoughts since I was 11. Horrible anxiety long before that. When he moved in with us, he brought with him a massive gun safe full of handguns and rifles. He taught us how to be safe around them and when I was younger he was very diligent about gun safety. The safe was always locked. \\n\\nI can’t remember the first time that changed. I was (and still am) into cracking safes. I went into our basement and only intended just to see if I could even hear the clicks of the dial because it was so thick but I found it unlocked. This made me really uncomfortable. The moment they showed up they’d always been a temptation, but an unreachable one. Now here they were. I wasn’t feeling horrible at that time so I shut it and locked it and asked my mother to tell him to keep it locked. \\n\\nThis happened several more times through the years. I always checked it when I was feeling okay, I had the wherewithal to do that at least, and it was always unlocked and again I asked my mom or him directly to keep it locked.\\n\\nThings got worse. I got worse. It’s never been this bad in my whole life. I’m not in an okay place right now. I spent some time in a mental health facility because all I could think about was going home in the middle of the night and getting one of his guns. Part of my discharge included a call to the two of them emphasizing how important it is to keep it locked. That was not even two weeks ago. I came back to visit and on a whim checked it. \\n\\nUnlocked.\\n\\nI can’t take it anymore. He wants me to love him and he tries to act like my father but he doesn’t even care about my safety. I’m torn because it is ultimately up to me not to use it, and I’m not a confrontational person. I’ve only ever cut off one person my whole life.

Unlike my dad, she never physically hurt me. My dad was really messed up and me and my brother used to be beaten real bad. But she never did anything to help and make it easier, either. She just let it happen and even watched sometimes.\\n\\nWhen I turned 17 I decided I wanted to get away from this. My dad has changed a lot since I was younger but with him around it still isn’t a good environment. He’s still abusive, controlling, and a shitty dad/husband. My relationship with my mom still isn’t good and I know she feels guilty for everything I went through. Our relationship consisted mostly of arguing and then her ignoring me and not caring what I do. \\n\\nI started looking into getting emancipated and decided I wanted to at least move out in a few months, before I turn 18. I wasn’t sure how I would to tell my parents about it until one night when me and my mom got into another argument. I had spent a Saturday at my girlfriend’s house. \\n\\nWhen I came back my mom was crying saying, “Where were you?”, and things like that. At first I wasn’t sure why she was acting like that because I asked if I could have done this and I showed her the texts, to which she responded, “I don’t remember sending those.”\\n\\nAt this point she’s still crying and saying, “I was so scared.” And at this point I’m just thinking, Why the fuck does she *care*. So as I head upstairs I tell her, “Get used to not having me around. I’ll be gone in a few months.” My mom’s face gets so pale and she says, “Nonono please don’t say that.” And then I told her I wanted to get emancipated and then we had a discussion about it. She seemed ok with it at the time and agreed it would be best for me.\\n\\nIn the days following after I reveal this, my mom acted really out of character for her. Every time my dad would yell at me or call me an insult or something, my mom would snap, “Please don’t talk to him like that!” She started being nice and talking to me more, asking me normal parent stuff like how was school or work. \\n\\nAfter 2 days of being nice she asks me if I still want to leave her and I said I was still going to get emancipated but she has a few months before it happens. She was instantly mad, called me selfish, screamed, “You’re not fucking leaving this damn house!”, and then walked to her room and slammed the door, not coming out for the rest of the day.\\n\\nOne day I come home from school to find my mom on the kitchen floor sobbing the hardest I’ve ever seen a person cry. Her face was all red and swollen and she was flailing herself around. I’m like what the fuck and she’s repeating the words “I want to die” over and over. She sees me and says, “You can’t leave. I need you to protect me. He won’t hurt us if you’re around.” At this point she’s screaming and I don’t know what to do so I lock myself in my room after telling her if it’s such a concern she could either leave him or go to the police or something.\\n\\n\\nThe next day my mom has me sit down and talk with her. She tells me some stuff I never knew before, thinking it would make us “closer”. Like: her parents were abusive too so she understands how I feel. She met my dad in middle school and they were married at 18. He wasn’t always like this and used to treat her nice . After marrying him, my mom never had to work a day in her life. My dad’s family owned a successful business that he inherited and all that. He took good care of my mom and had a lot if money. For that reason, she wants to continue being with him so her youngest daughter can have a good life.\\n\\n\\nShe apologized for how she treated me all these years and confessed that she used to resent me and my brother because of the way we were conceived, but she promised to be a better mother if I would stay with her for a few years because she couldn’t stand losing another son. She said, “Don’t leave me like your brother did.” She was crying so much telling me this and saying she was scared.\\n\\nI feel so bad for her. Originally I was going to move out and not have contact but I don’t know about that know. It seems shitty to do that. Would I be an asshole to leave her like this and not at least wait until I’m 18 to make her happy?\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 615745, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'WIBTA if I left home early, leaving my mom to fend for herself against my abusive dad?', 'updated_utc': 1554481822, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b7uzly/wibta_if_i_left_home_early_leaving_my_mom_to_fend/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

My mom got full custody of me cause dad had a fase in which he was extra irresponsible, and when I was little, I used to visit him regularly, but as HS and College started to become more exigent and I wanted to keep good grades, my visits became way less frequent. til I badly see here once a month.\\n\\nAs a result, I\\'m not very close to him and his side of the family, and I think it\\'s reciprocal. I\\'m left leaning and have a VISCERAL hatred for any kind of injustice or inhumane treatment - our country had an awful time with years of horrible right-wing dictatorship.\\n\\nNow u may be asking: k, this sucks, but what does this have to do with the family group?\\n\\nWell, my father\\'s family happens to be right-wing. Whenever the topic of politics come up, heated discussions r bound to happen. When dad created the group, he asked everyone to avoid the politics topic, but it didn\\'t take long before the right-wing, anti-left and sometimes plain dictatorship apologist stuff started pouring here and there. I tried to ignored, but eventually started posting some facts to counter. \\n\\nHe messaged me privately to ask that I stop talking bout politics to avoid fights, I replied that I\\'d stop as long as everyone else did the same. He argued that their posts weren\\'t only political, but also humorous. I started posting leftist memes and comedy videos and it didn\\'t take long before my aunt complained. Discussion ensued, and I got positively surprised when Dad took my side, but the joy was short lived.\\n\\nHe asked me to stop posting any politics related content in the group, and I argued that I was posting jokes like everyone else, but he said ppl were uncomfortable and that I should either ignore the bs or leave. \\n\\nI left. Then he told me that I didn’t have to leave the group, only stop talking bout politics, and that I should just stay and ignore stuff I don’t like, that this only proves that unlike the ppl I accuse of being intolerant I can’t live with adversity and yadda yadda. \\n\\nI replied firmly that the rules should apply to everyone equally, and that he either put the foot down and tell them to stop posting things attacking the left and its politicians, either tell them to accept when I counter with my posts. \\n\\nThen today he told me that ppl want me back in the group.\\n\\nWIBTA if I refuse? \\n\\nTL,DR: My dad created a family group on what\\'sapp. His side of the family is right-wing leaning and I\\'m leftist, so he asked people to avoid the topic of politics. They ignored his request and made posts attacking the left, then complained when I started countering their posts. When I argued that the rules should be the same and apply equally to everyone, my father asked me to either ignore their posts or leave. I left. Now they want me back in the group.

However I am ready to cancel the wedding and instead elope because my family (primarily mom and grandma) will not stop bringing up my weight. Full disclosure, I’m not in the best shape I’d like to be (I weigh around 170 pounds and am 5’5 ) so I could definitely stand to lose 10-20 pounds which I plan on doing anyways over the next two years before the wedding\\n\\nThe first thing my mom asked me after getting engaged is if I had an idea for dresses yet and if I was going to lose weight for the wedding. I said I was planning to drop about 10-20 lbs but instead they insisted I should lose at least 50-60 or else I would regret my wedding day forever. I’ve only been engaged for about a month but I’ve heard these comments enough times that if I had a dollar for each time, I’d have enough to pay for my wedding and then some\\n\\nNow background story. My mom had me at 22 and decided she was not ready to raise a child so she left me at my grandparents when I was less than 1 and let them raise me. Throughout my upbringing she was not there and constantly missed parts of my life. The biggest one being that she used to promise to come to my birthdays, school/sports events but then never showed. She claimed me every year on her taxes but never gave the money to either myself or my grandparents. My mom also has never apologized for not being there and instead thinks I owe her so much and that she’s the reason I’m so successful (I’m not that successful, I just have a normal middle class job  working for a start up and save carefully as much as I can). \\n\\nToday after another slew of comments I decided to text my mom since I was simply at my breaking point. I sent “this is the last time I am saying this but if one more person in this family comments on my weight or that I’m too fat to get married then I will cancel the wedding and elope and that’s that. You are free to tell grandma if you like as well.”\\n\\nMy mom has now turned the whole situation on me and stated that she never said anything like that to me and that if my grandma was saying things like that then I should tell her instead. I was like ok well, maybe I’m being harsh so I then tried to explain to her how hurtful stuff like that is and that she absolutely does bring up my weight every time we speak and not to deny it.  I asked her to put herself in my shoes and imagine if she was engaged and her mom was bringing up her weight constantly. My mom is now saying that I’m just using her as a punching bag and that I’ve treated her like this my whole life which I don’t understand since we’ve barely had a relationship for a majority of my life.I’m so frustrated and been bawling me eyes out all night since I really am considering just eloping and cutting my family off completely.\\n\\nSorry for the wall of text... am I the asshole? \\n\\n', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 615810, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'top', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for telling my mom that if she commented on my weight again that I’d cancel my wedding and just elope', 'updated_utc': 1554482009, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b7v7ix/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_if_she_commented_on/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

My heart feels so heavy right now. Here\\'s the backstory..\\nI have vaginismus (a condition where the pelvic muscles tighten when something goes into your vagina, causing extremely painful penetration) because of this, my boyfriend and I have had sex maybe 10 times in the past five months. I\\'ve just now worked up the courage to seek treatment - and then this happened. We were talking about splitting the cost of a set of dilators, which is a form of treatment for my condition. During the conversation he said \"honestly, I don\\'t know if I want you to get these. I\\'m extremely jealous of something else being in your vagina.\" Of course I was like, are you shitting me rn? But I guess I kinda understand, I mean that\\'s how some guys are. Then he started going on about why he was so jealous, and one of the things he brought up is that he doesn\\'t feel like his penis is big enough and I would enjoy dilators more than I would enjoy him. I was totally taken aback by this comment. He\\'s always been proud of his size, and I have too - reassuring him of this many times. But I don\\'t know, I feel like since we haven\\'t been having sex lately? maybe he\\'s getting insecure about it? We do other things that we enjoy but I guess he needs more. Anyways I was going on &amp; on about how it was just the right size, &amp; I wouldn\\'t want it to be any bigger. I already struggle with the size it is now. This is when he says, \"don\\'t take this the wrong way, but I wish another girl could see it and tell me if it\\'s big or not.\" I got really quiet and he was like. \"Seriously, don\\'t be mad I just wish other people could see it just so I can know.\" As soon as he said that, I hung up the phone. I sent him a message and said \"if you need some random girl to tell you your penis is big enough, go ahead idc\" and I felt terrible because he\\'s so supportive of what I go through, but now I feel like he might cheat on me.

It’s quite possibly I am an asshole but at the time it didn’t feel like it. \\n\\nMy husband and I had been shopping, with our 4 month old. We returned to the car park, a large multi-storey affair and while my husband was loading up the car, I was stood next to the car with the baby in the buggy. The whole thing was less than 2 minutes and we weren’t dawdling. \\n\\nIn front of where the parking spaces are there’s a small walkway marked out for pedestrians to safely enter the shopping centre. This is where I was stood, with the buggy, by the car. I was in no one’s way. A space just adjacent to our car was free and a middle aged couple were manoeuvring to reverse into the space. (Crap diagram- https://i.imgur.com/oIWwpdZ.jpg - cars are blue squares. I am the red dot standing on pedestrian area next to our car) \\n\\nSuddenly I heard a bit of a kerfuffle and looked over, realising they were motioning and shouting at me to move. We were literally less than 30 seconds away from having baby out of the buggy and into her car seat, so I asked them to wait a minute.\\n\\nThey then pull their windows down and ask (well, yell really) again for me to get out of the way. My husband then said “there’s more than enough room for you to get into that space and my wife is standing on a pedestrian area.” \\n\\nThey huffed, but then managed to quite easily get into the space. Just as I was taking baby out of buggy they then purposefully drove forward out of the space straight at me and baby and shouted out of their window “Sorry just straightening up” \\n\\nAt that point I was thoroughly irritated. I shook my head at them, stared them both in the eye and gave them the middle finger because I couldn’t think of anything more inventive to be honest. \\n\\nI felt like a complete petulant child afterwards but there was more than enough space for them to get in, there were loads of other free spaces and we were already in the process of getting ready to leave when we arrived - they surely could have waited. \\n\\nAm I the asshole?   \\n\\n', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 615861, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'top', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for refusing to move my buggy and giving a middle aged couple the middle finger?', 'updated_utc': 1554482189, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b7vdza/aita_for_refusing_to_move_my_buggy_and_giving_a/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

He works the evening shift, while I work the graveyard shift and there's this girl I saw that I was really attracted to. I was reluctant to approach her because I am her indirect supervisor ( She wasn't my dedicated employee but I would frequently cover for her supervisor or relay directions to her group for operational purposes)\\n\\nFast forward they have been dating for a year or more. One day he ends the relationship and they go their separate ways. He didn't feel the same way about her that she did towards him. I made no effort to talk to her whatsoever. \\n\\nFast forward again about a year and a half later he has a new gf that he's really serious about. One day his ex reaches out to me to buy some weed from me (I was growing at the time and would post pictures om my snapchat). I met up with her to sell her some bud and she asked me to hangout for a little bit and I agreed. I had absolutely no intention of hooking up with her, because of her history with my roommate, but one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together. It happened several more times after this mainly because I felt very comfortable around her and enjoyed her company. \\n\\nOne day I decided to tell him what was going on, because I don't like to keep secrets from my close friends. Initially he just brushed it off, but the next day he told me he felt like I betrayed him and it was fucked up that I had hooked up with her on several different occasions. \\n\\nFor me I feel like I did nothing wrong because i didn't initiate or seek her out, but also because he was the one who broke up with her and on top of that it has been well over a year AND he has a new gf who he is in love with. He said he still has strong feelings for her and if that's true than why did you end the relationship? He told me to promise him that I would never see her again and I agreed.\\n\\nAm I wrong for wanting to be around someone that makes me feel like I am cared about eventhough they have history with a very close friend of mine? I didn't want to get inimate with her, she initiated it and I didn't stop her because it felt right and I was very lonely. Is it more important that I keep him happy or pursue my own happiness? \\n\\nTLDR; my roommate broke up with his gf a year and a half ago and currently has a new gf. His ex contacted me and we ended up getting intimate with eachother unintentionally (at least on my behalf I can't speak for her intentions). I felt the need to confess this to him and he feels like I betrayed our friendship and wants me to promise never to talk to her again.

She is nearing retirement age, she has no saving and she cannot drive, and we live in a rural community where work in the local area is scarce. Also important is that I have not seen her or even spoken to her in over 20 years and my fiancée has never met her. \\n\\nMy fiancée and I have been together for approximately 5 years but only moved in together about a year ago. Our house is a very small 2 bed, although the 2nd room is barely more than a box room - it's fine for the two of us, but it gets cramped if we have anyone round. Financially we are comfortable, but we are by no means well off. We're also getting married later this year and plan to start trying for a baby immediately after that. This is all important context. \\n\\nMy father is emigrating later this year, and on christmas day he took me to one side and put me on the spot; if his sister is not on her feet by the time he moves, will we take her in? I was taken aback but I did not give him an answer either way as I was not willing to commit without my fiancé's input. Shortly afterwards however, we returned to the lounge and my father phoned another member of family and, in front of my completely oblivious fiancée, informed them that we'd be happy to take in his sister. My fiancée was gobsmacked but said nothing. After we left however, she erupted and we had a major row - again, on christmas day. Because of the way she found out, she thought I was in on these plans and had agreed to all of this behind her back, and though I eventually convinced her that I was as much in the dark on this as she was, it nevertheless ruined our christmas.\\n\\nAfter calming down, we sat and talked and decided that we would not take her in. Housing her would compromise our privacy, it would potentially hamper our future plans re: trying for a baby, and  we are simply not in a position financially support a third adult right now. A few days later we went to my father's house to tell him this, however he became very angry and told us to get out. Since then, I have barely spoken to him, and on the few instances that I have, the atmosphere between us has been noticeably different. I understand the reasons for her leaving the country she was in, but I feel as though my father took it for granted that my fiancée and I, who are just starting our own lives together, would step up to the plate to support her whilst he moves to another country to start a new life for himself. As terrible as I feel for her, it's not a burden that we are in a position to take on, even if she is family.\\n\\nAm I/my fiancée the asshole in all of this?\", 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 615959, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'top', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for refusing to take in a member of my family?', 'updated_utc': 1554482497, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b7vnw2/aita_for_refusing_to_take_in_a_member_of_my_family/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

They both have talked about it in first of me before this— they want to get me a Jeep, they asked me what color I want, etc...\\nAnd that’s awesome! It was exciting to have parents so eager to talk about this stuff, and I absolutely recognized my privilege.\\nThat is, until I finally brought it up at dinner tonight.\\nI asked my dad a hesitant question: “Hey dad, I know the dates a little far off, but I was wondering when it gets closer if we could talk about getting a car?”\\nMy dad stops before giving a short, almost incredulous chuckle— “Why do you assume you’re getting a car?”\\nI was taken aback by this.

However, I’m not going to turn my nose up at a generous offer, because I feel that would be ungrateful.\\nSo I kind of laugh like “Sorry for asking— forget it” and my mom storms off dramatically, saying she “Can’t even have a conversation with me”— I’m then told it was a “bad look on me” to have ‘assumed’ I was getting a car by my dad. \\nHere’s the thing— I hardly even WANT a car.

We live far away from everyone we know, I'm tired of being alone all the time with our kid. His work also prevents me from traveling for MY job. He tells me I'm a nag and to suck it up.\\n\\n\\nMy husband and I have been together for 4+ years, married for 1.5. We have an infant daughter together. He's an engineer and I'm a project manager. My job lets me work from home as long as I'm putting in 40 hours per week, and I have to travel about once or twice per month (no more than 2 trips of 2-3 days each). \\n\\nWe moved to another state in the US (Indiana from Pennsylvania) away from all of our family &amp; friends on the idea that he would have a job where he'd only travel 30% of the time and take a significant pay increase (from ~90k to over 115k per year). His previous job (in Pennsylvania) had him traveling Mon - Friday EVERY week, with maybe 2-3 business days at home if we were lucky. This seemed like a big improvement. It's also a nice city. \\n\\nWhen he took the new job, his company paid our moving expenses, so we were stuck for 2 years. If he left within the 2 year mark, he'd have to pay ALL of them back ($20,000). So, we just dealt with the fact that his travel was NOT 30%, and he wasn't making as much as they promised him (no bonuses the past 2 years). Those 2 years are now up as of 1/1/19.\\n\\nHis travel has consistently been at 70+%. This has been *so difficult* for me, at first because I was pregnant, then because we are first time homeowners and it's like there's always *something* to do, and now because I'm essentially single-parenting our kid. I love my daughter, but I struggled way longer than I should've with PPD because I had no support system.\\n\\nMy husband says that there are plenty of people out there who are single parents with less money, and that his job is supposed to be easing up on travel for the rest of the year. **He's off on a trip now, though, for the ENTIRE MONTH OF APRIL and MAYBE he'll get to come home 1 weekend.** I say maybe because he's been told that before and not been able to come home. He's told me that I'm just weak for being frustrated with him being gone, and that I'm nagging him about quitting when his job makes us way more money than mine does. He says I should just focus on losing weight and making friends.\\n\\nWhen he's gone for these huge stretches, it also means I CAN'T travel for my job, which makes me look bad in front of my boss. I've tried to get him to commit to not going on a trip if I already has one scheduled, and he's said he 'can't promise anything'. \\n\\nBut the other big problem is that this just isn't the life I want. I love my husband and even though we have our issues I want us to be together. \\n\\nWe keep fighting about this and he says I'm an asshole for harping on this constantly.

She continued making comments, finally involving her husband, having him take me aside and ask if she could just have a little bit, since it smelled so good to her. She involved her husband to ask me, as well as publicly making a fuss about how I wasn’t sharing, despite me explaining the situation.\\nMy gut says I’m NTA, but I’ve also never been pregnant, so I’m not sure how intense the cravings can really be.', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 616051, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'top', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for not giving a pregnant woman my food?', 'updated_utc': 1554482722, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b7vwkr/aita_for_not_giving_a_pregnant_woman_my_food/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

I live in florida and she lives in New York. She told me she might be moving down to Florida and I was pretty surprised to say the least. Understandably she told me she wanted to stay in New York because of friends, floridas too hot, ect.  I said Florida isnt as bad as she thinks, and it would be cool to see eachother. Then she says that New York has a better education system any ways so it would be dumb to move there. Then thats when our argument started. I showed her state rankings based on education and Florida was in fact rated higher than New york. She replied saying that my evidence was fake because the ranking with New York wasn\\'t New Yorks flag. I replied with an image of New York\\'s flag which was same flag used in the Rankings. May I add that at this point the argument wasn\\'t heated, so I poked fun at her saying \"you dont even know your own states flag lmao\". She said that your going to find untrusted sites on the internet and find information for anything. I said that she used a blog post from 2007 as her \"evidence\" while i used an official site using data from 2018. She stood her ground though and said using the internet for evidence is not real evidence. Then started using stuff like bigfoot and mermaid sightings to prove her point. I said that she\\'s being childish not accepting your wrong even when proven so. She then snapped at me saying \"No but it must be pretty hard to get a 15 year old midget gamer boy (Im 5, 2) to stfu\". I replied saying \"shit now i remember why i stopped talking to u\" and \"stay there, we dont need retarded new yorkers\". Did I go harsh on her?

Roughly 6 months ago, I came out to everyone except my grandparents.\\n\\nAbout a month and a half later, I came out to my grandparents via a letter. I spent a week or two writing it, and I am extremely proud of it. It\\'s well written, it perfectly displays my perspective in a way that can be understood, and I even listed resources at the end of the letter to help them understand! I wrote it because I was too nervous to speak to them in person. I was partially afraid my grandfather might get violent or start yelling, so even though they live five minutes away I decided to just drive over and give them the letter.\\n\\nI was terrified, to say the least. They were forced by their parents to go to church 7 days a week when they were kids and they whole-heartedly believed God was the most amazing thing to ever exist. There\\'s nothing wrong with being Christian at all, but they are racist, homophobic, xenophobic, etc. That\\'s not being Christian, that\\'s using it as an excuse to hate. They are typical southerners in the fact that they look down on anyone who isn\\'t straight, white, and Christian. Essentially, they are everything that I am against. I love them, but holy hell are they close-minded.\\n\\nI didn\\'t expect them to be completely accepting, but I also didn\\'t expect their response. They wrote back a letter, scrawled on notebook paper in blue ink. It was nothing but references to the bible and religion themes, and they invalidated my entire existence. \"A man cannot be a woman, God made you this way, blah blah\". Once again, I\\'m not saying being religious is bad, but I believe there\\'s a difference between believing something and becoming an extremist. They said I felt the way I did because the Devil was controlling me. I was being led by Satan himself in their eyes. That pissed me off so much! I showed so much empathy to them with my letter! I never once invalidated their religion, I never called them anything derogatory, and though I despised their views, I was always respectful and loving to them. I never once imposed my beliefs onto them. *This* is how they respond! I was the fucking *devil* to them!\\n\\nMy parents were pissed as well, and for a month or two, there was silence. My grandparents eventually \"came around\". They still used my old name and called me their grandson, but at least they stopped calling people faggots around me, right? With time they\\'ve gotten a little better, but I still feel like I won\\'t be able to connect with them ever again. \\n\\nI\\'m still hurt by the fact that some of my closest family saw me and possibly still sees me as a devil. I don\\'t know how to forgive them. Though I talk to them and I still go to family things with them, I can\\'t bring myself to forgive or forget what they did. I remind myself that they\\'re old, and that I need to spend my time with them wisely, but they make me sick.\\n\\nMaybe I\\'m some fascist asshole. Maybe I\\'m in the wrong.

We live far away from everyone we know, I'm tired of being alone all the time with our kid. His work also prevents me from traveling for MY job. He tells me I'm a nag and to suck it up.\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy husband and I have been together for 4+ years, married for 1.5. We have an infant daughter together. He's an engineer and I'm a project manager. We moved to another state &amp; away from all of our family &amp; friends on the idea that he would have a job where he'd only travel 30% of the time and take a significant pay increase (from \\\\~90k to over 115k per year). His previous job (in Pennsylvania) had him traveling Mon - Friday EVERY week, with maybe 2-3 business days at home if we were lucky. This seemed like a big improvement. It's also a nice city. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy job lets me work from home as long as I'm putting in 40 hours per week, and I have to travel about once or twice per month (no more than 2 trips of 2-3 days each). \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhen he took the new job, his company paid our moving expenses, so that meant he \\\\*\\\\*had\\\\*\\\\* to stay or we'd have to repay $20,000 in expenses. However, both his travel and compensation haven't been what he was promised. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHis travel has consistently been at 70+%. This has been \\\\*so difficult\\\\* for me, at first because I was pregnant, and now because I'm essentially single-parenting our kid. I love my daughter, but I struggled way longer than I should've with PPD because I had no support system.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy husband says that there are plenty of people out there who are single parents with less money, and that his job is supposed to be easing up on travel for the rest of the year. He's told me that I'm just weak for being frustrated with him being gone, and that I'm nagging him about quitting when his job makes us way more money than mine does. He says I should just focus on losing weight and making friends.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFor context, he was gone 4 weeks in January, at least 50% of February and March, and now is gone all of April. When he's gone for these huge stretches, it also means I CAN'T travel for my job, which makes me look bad in front of my boss. I've tried to get him to commit to not going on a trip if I already has one scheduled, and he's said he 'can't promise anything'. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBut the other big problem is that this just isn't the life I want. I love my husband and even though we have our issues I want us to be together. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe keep fighting about this and he says I'm an asshole for harping on this constantly.

While home this past weekend, my sister went to a wedding and I went to a show with my mom. When we got back, I made plans to go out with my friends.

She’s taken over my bathroom (that I used to share with our other sister) now too, even though she has her own, so it really feels like I have nowhere in the house I can be alone.

I have 3 bio kids (10,12 and 13) and 2 step kids (9 and 11). My husband and I agreed a long time ago that we did not want to get cellphones (specifically smart phones) for our kids. We decided this for multiple reasons but mainly financial/we saw it as an unnecessary and potentially dangerous device. A few months ago, my step kids mom decided that she wanted to get my step kids phones since her step daughter had one. She asked my husband his opinion (he told her) and if he was willing to contribute (he wasn't) and then went ahead with it. My bio kids went through some jealousy (particularly the 13 year old who couldn't understand why her 9 year old sister would have one and not her) but they've gotten past it now. The problem is that in going through a recent redesign of the custody/child support order, it looks like my husband will be required to pay significantly less support, and now his ex is asking that he pay half of their cell phone bills. My husband is leaning towards agreeing so as not to derail the negotiations, but I'm feeling pretty bad about this. We've been able to explain to my bio kids that their step siblings phones were their moms thing and that we still stood by our decision to not have them. However now that we might be contributing to it, I feel like we're sending mixed messages to the kids. And if we just don't mention that we're paying it to the kids, I still feel like I'm being an arsehole for not treating them relatively fair.

TL:DR at the bottom. \\n\\nNow, when I say the teenage years have been difficult, it’s pretty standard stuff. Nothing too crazy. I am also a very hands-off step parent when it comes to making rules. I had a horrible step mom when I was growing up that was given full control over my life (making rules, discipline, etc) and I have no interest in being remotely like that. My step son has two parents already and it’s not my place. That being said, the kid has zero responsibilities at home. No chores, nothing. Literally sits and plays Fortnite all day when he is not at school. Not an exaggeration.\\n\\nI feel like we need to get this dude ready for real life! My husband isn’t doing him any favors by being his personal maid. He makes his bed, does his laundry, cleans his bathroom and bedroom, and puts his dishes in the dishwasher. The kid cannot/will not do anything for himself.\\n \\nWhen we all moved in together, I tried asking him to put his dishes in the dishwasher and he would do it for a day or so, then go back to leaving them on the counter for my husband and me to do.  Now, when it’s my turn to do the dishes after dinner, I will leave his dishes in the counter where he left them. I vehemently do not agree with this dynamic and refuse to do something so remedial that the kid can do for himself. My husband knows how I feel on the whole issue of him not doing chores, yet still doesn’t act on it, so I feel like he can clean up after him. Obviously, my husband and I equally care for the home in general, this is just my one hill that I am prepared to die on. So, AITA here?\\n\\nTL:DR: step son does zero chores at home and my husband does everything for him.

My dad, uncle I’m not really close to, and his 16 year old son are all attending a family wedding over the weekend. I’m 30, close to the groom and have already sunk a lot of time and money into the various out of state parties leading up to this, so I’m trying to do this as cheaply as possible. I agreed to split a hotel room with my dad, but after seeing the high prices of hotels in the area, suggested an Airbnb. After finding a particularly pricy one that was up to his standards, he mentioned that we should leave enough room for the uncle and cousin. I say okay, and think that’s even better because then my dad and uncle can split the bill between them as usual, and I’ll just give my dad half of his share. My dad calls my uncle to confirm, and upon hearing the uncle balk at the price, blurts out that we can split it three ways instead of two. I get pretty mad about this because we didn’t discuss this and now I’m paying way more than I planned to. Now, I know the 16 year old is in no way to be held financially responsible for the weekend. However, I don’t think it’s fair that my dad and I have to subsidize the uncle’s room share, when he and my cousin are taking up just as much of the house. It’s equivalent to my dad and I splitting a hotel as planned, then going next door and giving my uncle more money to keep things fair. Now everyone’s upset and I feel like a heel but I still think my logic is sound.

I watched the new diss track and while the reception of the video has been overwhelmingly positive, I think there's a quite few problematic things with it, I think the whole video was just thinly veiled attacks against Indians and promoted anti Indian sentiments because Pewdiepie knows that it is an effective way to rally SOME (not all) of his fans to boost his subscriber numbers, it really annoyed me that he was literally trying to spread hate against a racial group purely for his self interest.  While you can and should criticize countries for violation of human rights and corruption, it was completely irrelevant to the whole sub war and at least India is trying to get solve issues like the caste system and poverty (for example, the president is a low caste member and the government has made casteism illegal for a while now and provided many policies in place to help them, open defecation is being massively curbed, people are gaining access to the internet at unprecedented rates).\\n\\nWhen I called him out on this, he said he was just joking and that he just wants a creator to be at the top instead of a company, I 100% agree with that, but I told him that pewdiepie is a terrible person and creator who has done some hideous things in the past, like making r\\\\*pe jokes back in his early youtube career, saying the n word, making anti semitic jokes to an audience he knows is predominantly young and impressionable.

Am I the asshole?\\n\\nTo give context:\\nMe and about 5 friends have a group chat on Snapchat. We all play video games together, mostly fortnite, and it\\'s used to talk about the game and to see if people are on and want to get on. I am definitely the best player out of all of them, everyone else plays for fun while I like competitive and tournaments. \\n\\nSo to start the argument its between me and my friend aidan. I send a text in the group chat asking Aidan is so upset that I play so much. This is what my other friend Josh said:\\n\\n\"Because u shove it in his face a game he has loved and made a big part of his life and after all his time playing you are still way better and u make it a constant reminder that he is and will never be as good as you.\" \\n\\nAnd my response is very long to this. \\n\\n\"That\\'s rediculous, I don\\'t shove it in his face, but I do when he calls me a bot, trash, sweaty, tryhard, loser and that i play too much. He is toxic so I return the favor. I posted a screenshot of my kd, it was above a 2.0. All I said was \"2 kd let\\'s go\" just felt good about it, happy about how I\\'ve grown in game in such little time. And the answers I got were you (josh) calling me a bot, and aidan calling me a bitch. No reason. Yes, I said something before that about me having 170 points and not playing with Connor because he is a bot. That was a joke, and I\\'ll explain why. I was saying that because I wasn\\'t getting on. That wasn\\'t the reason why, because he\\'s a bot, I am helping my mom plan a party. Thats why. So that clears that up. And then, aidan gets upset and tries to one up me. \"Mobile kd is 5\". So I say prove it, and he goes on to say it was an exaggeration. Okay cool. And then I bring up the case of him having 150 or so wins on mobile, and I tell him to prove that. I know it\\'s not an exaggeration because he says it many times. Last Friday, he insisted he got 10 wins in 1 night. Highly unbelievable, that\\'s good for most streamers to get in the amount of time he played. And he proceeds to get pissed and say, \"stop fucking(?) fortnite. It\\'s dog shit\" Furthering my case of aidan disliking the game. It\\'s completely his fault why I decide to try and dominate him. He is toxic and starts random fights, calling me things that are completely unnecessary. \\nI get what you\\'re saying josh. But I\\'m afraid that it is not my fault. And I\\'m afraid you\\'re on the wrong side. Aidan just gets mad at the smallest things. Like getting one pumped in fortnite, to me being happy that I did well in a tournament. Kolbie [my other friend]  sends a picture of his 11 kill triumphant win in arena and everyone gives him a pat on the back. But when I send a screenshot of my triumph in getting above a 2.0 kd, everyone shits on me for being hyped and joyful. Doesn\\'t make sense to me.\"\\n\\nAm I the asshole?

They've been one of my closest friends for about 15 years and they recently moved in with me because they were having some financial trouble (by *trouble* I mean reckless spending and no personal budgeting to the point where they couldn't handle their rent on their own).\\n\\n*Also important to note:* while we're generally comfortable acknowledging each other's personal space at this point, I totally get that it's not typically okay to go into somebody's room without asking first. They've told me since they've moved in that if I needed anything for the common areas that they haven't yet unpacked or we initially didn't think we'd have room for, I was welcome to go into their room, and 'rummage' through their boxes to get it. I still feel like a shitty person for going in though, so I'm having trouble deciding how to approach the following situation.\\n\\nBefore they moved in, I was already aware that their cleanliness isn't all that great. So I made a point to make sure we had an understanding that I don't care what they do behind closed doors in their room and bathroom, as long as they respect the common areas and to keep in mind that my apartment has been known as a cozy spot for spiders Long with a cockroach or two (gross, I know), especially during warmer weather. Because of this I've always been super anal about making sure my place is clean, as in no food or dirty dishes lying around,  no clothes on the floors, nothing that could potentially make these asshole critters think I'm running a buggy-brothel. Basically I told them, obviously it's your room, your bathroom, do what you want, but be mindful about the basics.\\n\\nIt's been about three months now. Their door is always closed and we're on completley opposite sleep and work schedules, so aside from the weekends, it's rare that we even cross paths. Noticed a week ago that the central air didn't seem to be cooling. I had this problem last summer, so I told my friend that if it got too warm or stuffy, just open their window and let me know that way I'm not trying to force the air unit to overwork with windows open. They insisted they were fine, but okay. Air seemed to be okay for a few days until it this week, I noticed it again. Except this time the register was reading under 60 even though my bedroom and the living room felt like a sauna. Asked them if they had the window open, and if they noticed the warmth at all. They said no, they were fine. Figured I'd just put in a maintenance ticket tomorrow morning and have them look at. Brushed it off, turned the unit off and opened all the windows knowing I went through this with them last year.\\n\\n*For clarity, our bedrooms face the back of the building. I always park in the front lot, so I wouldn't have noticed their room, and I have no reason not to take friend's word for it especially considering they had a similar with their apartment. Anyone familiar with central air should undwrstand why you don't leave doors and windows open while trying to force air throughout the apartment. Rentals have cheap units to begin with, it's only a matter of time before you break it, and have to deal with a ridiculously high electric bill.*\\n\\nCue today: ran out to do some errands, came back and randomly decided to park in the back lot. I have to walk past our rooms to get to my door this way. Noticed that their bedroom window was open when I've been running the air all day. They aren't home and won't be until early in AM so I took it upon myself to go in and close their window, figuring that I could turn the unit off, let it recalibrate and see if I could get it working again before resorting to maintenance. First thing I noticed was how filthy their room is. By filthy I literally mean filthy. Nevermind that I couldn't see a single inch of carpet because of all their clothes, papers, and turned out boxes. We're talking a couple dozen open (presumably empty) soda cans, an open plate with a pizza slice from a few weeks ago (identifiable as the one we got a few weeks ago b/c of the toppings), a couple forks jammed into the carpet, a few cups, plates and plastic containers with leftover dinners from the course of the past few weeks, *personal* used items, etc... I also saved a pretty giant spider that was resting on a sock while trying to make my way across the room to the damn window.\\n\\nI'm absolutely livid because it feels like even though we've been good friends for 15 years, they're completely disrespecting my home (their room used to be my home office and gym, which is space I've had for 4 years now that I decided to sacrifice for them) and the help I've extended by giving them a place to stay, even though if it weren't for poor money habits, they wouldn't need it (off-lease, meaning I'm also putting myself at risk of landlord drama), until they get back on their feet.\\n\\nObviously, I can't have the apartment in that condition because I've learned that even when everything is spotless, my building tends to have serious insect problems in the summer. On the same token, I went into their room without asking, without them knowing which is how I found out about it. I'm conflicted because I know it's shitty for anyone to invade personal space, friend or not. If I don't wait up until 5am to confront them, we won't cross paths again for weeks because of our work/sleep schedules and I'm about to go out of town in a few days. Obviously I can't take their word for it by just asking if they're keeping things cleaned because they've told me before numerous times that everything was good.\\n\\nAITA for entering their room, and WIBTA for confronting them about the state of said room?\", 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 616309, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'WIBTA for confronting my roommate about their cleanliness?', 'updated_utc': 1554483783, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b7wr99/wibta_for_confronting_my_roommate_about_their/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

They've been one of my closest friends for about 15 years and they recently moved in with me because they were having some financial trouble (by *trouble* I mean reckless spending and no personal budgeting to the point where they couldn't handle their rent on their own).\\n\\n*Also important to note:* while we're generally comfortable acknowledging each other's personal space at this point, I totally get that it's not typically okay to go into somebody's room without asking first. They've told me since they've moved in that if I needed anything for the common areas that they haven't yet unpacked or we initially didn't think we'd have room for, I was welcome to go into their room, and 'rummage' through their boxes to get it. I still feel like a shitty person for going in though, so I'm having trouble deciding how to feel about and approach the following situation.\\n\\nBefore they moved in, I was already aware that their cleanliness isn't all that great. So I made a point to make sure we had an understanding that I don't care what they do behind closed doors in their room and bathroom, as long as they respect the common areas and to keep in mind that my apartment has been known to host spiders with a cockroach or two (gross, I know), especially during warmer weather. Because of this I've always been super anal about making sure my place is clean, as in no food or dirty dishes lying around, no clothes on the floors, nothing that could potentially make these asshole critters think I'm running a buggy-brothel. Basically I told them, obviously it's your room, your bathroom, do what you want, but be mindful about the basics.\\n\\nIt's been about three months now. Their door is always closed and we're on completley opposite sleep and work schedules, so aside from the weekends, it's rare that we even cross paths. Noticed a week ago that the central air didn't seem to be cooling. I had this problem last summer, so I told my friend that if it got too warm or stuffy, just open their window and let me know that way I'm not trying to force the air unit to overwork with windows open. They insisted they were fine, but okay. Air seemed to be okay for a few days until it this week, I noticed it again. Except this time the register was reading under 60 even though my bedroom and the living room felt like a sauna. Asked them if they had the window open, and if they noticed the warmth at all. They said no, they were fine. Figured I'd just put in a maintenance ticket tomorrow morning and have them look at. Brushed it off, turned the unit off and opened all the windows knowing I went through this with them last year.\\n\\n*continued in comments due to length*\", 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 616341, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'top', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': \"WIBTA for entering my roommate's room and confronting them about their cleanliness?\", 'updated_utc': 1554483848, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b7wv4t/wibta_for_entering_my_roommates_room_and/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

On mobile, please forgive typos, etc. TW: child abuse.\\n\\nTLDR - AITA for never wanting to go to another out-of-state wedding of my sibling's if they invite my abuser?\\n\\nINFO: Sibling &amp; I are not super close, but not strained. More like friendly acquaintances, esp since they moved out of state, specifically to the state where our DeadBeat Dad lives. Sibling has a good relationship with DeadBeat. I have no relationship whatsoever with DeadBeat, due to the fact that he physically abused me when I was a toddler.\\n\\nMom had left him when pregnant with me, then took him back when I was about two or three years old. He was only with us for a year or so, but he beat and derided me pretty consistently throughout, as well as and verbally abusing our Mom and stealing from us/Mom's friends/our neighbors to support his crack cocaine habit.\\n\\nBecause he abused and traumatized me during early childhood development, I now suffer from clinical major depression &amp; generalized anxiety disorder, with regular anxiety- and panic-attacks. I've developed coping strategies, but a large part of me blames my suffering on DeadBeat. I still have vivid dreams and memories about the times he beat me every once in awhile.\\n\\nSo, Sibling doesn't remember this as they were a fetus/infant at the time. DeadBeat was imprisoned for theft and drugs basically right after they were born. They didn't have contact with him until they were already an adult. They grew up without ever knowing him &amp; always had a very romanticized view of what having him in our lives would be like. So when he offered them financial help for their newborn and a place to stay, they jumped at it. Understandable, I guess.\\n\\nISSUE: Sibling's 2nd wedding is coming up. DeadBeat will be there. I thought I was going to be able to handle being near him, esp. as Sibling assures me I don't even have to speak to him or his current wife. However, in these past months leading up to this wedding, my panic attacks &amp; overall anxiety have gotten much more frequent, and I've been struggling more with depressive episodes than I have in recent years. The only major change in my life has been this upcoming wedding. I think it's getting to me more than I initially thought it would. Not to mention that it's out of state, and I'm not in the best financial shape, so there's that added stress.

In this case, I think ghosting is the route to go but am unsure and want to avoid hurting anyone as much as possible. \\n\\nSo, last year, when I was in high school, I became friends with Jenny and Bruce. We all vibed off each other really well and just generally had a fun time together. Jenny, however, began to do things that bugged me. She'd be very passive aggressive, straight up ignore you if she was upset sometimes, and be manipulative. She could also often be emotionally draining to be around. While I am willing to support a friend in need, when it was just me and her alone, she'd turn the conversation to her personal problems nearly every time we spoke. She was beginning to be too much for me, but I figured maybe it'd pass.\\n\\nAfter we all graduated, I wanted to continue hanging out with her and Bruce because we all had fun together. For the most part, it was a decent time. But I found that she kept doing more and more things that irked me. Eventually, I realized I was going to my other friends complaining about the things she'd do, and that's when two things hit me: A) that I sort of dislike Jenny, and B) that that's a pretty shitty, asshole-ish thing to do. Friends shouldn't be complaining about you behind your back, and friends don't act like they like you to your face when in reality they sort of dislike you. Jenny and I aren't very close anyway, and we don't text on the daily or anything. In fact, we rarely text or talk outside of hanging out with Bruce at all. I think if I were to ghost her, she probably wouldn't notice too much. I should also clarify that by ghosting, I wouldn't lose her number or anything. I would still respond to a text if she sent one, but I wouldn't be initiating any conversations, and I certainly won't be hanging out with her again. Also, if she were to ask if we were still friends or why I'm not really around anymore, I'd give her an honest answer. I just want to make sure that this approach of, just kind of... not initiating anything... makes me a dick or if I should confront her straight-up and be honest now.\\n\\nTL;DR: Became friends with this girl, realized I sort of dislike her and decided I don't want to be her friend anymore.

This caused him to be kicked out of the house with no warning,  I went with him we slept in our car for a week then at my grandma's for another luckily we found an apartment after that. I'm glossing over a lot of hardship and drama so we can get to the point. \\n\\nSo a few years pass things are awkward I pretty much convinced my whole family minus my sister and her husband aka my niece's parents that my boyfriend was innocent and finally she even confessed to my mom just this past winter break that nothing happened now that she is 16 and a bit more mature. Basically she broke down crying and felt awful and just wanted to see us again. I'd also just got married to said boyfriend so I think this sparked the conversation. \\n\\nMy mom is fully expecting me to have a chat with her and try to work things out so I can rejoin Christmas. I just feel like she ruined a huge part of my life. I'm still getting anxiety stress just typing this out. I  get that she was just a dumb kid with overactive fantasies.  Am I maybe angry at the wrong person? \\n\\nTldr; neice accused my boyfriend(now husband)of molesting her, years later confessed it wasn't true. Mom wants me to reconcile with her so I can attend Christmas. \", 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 616441, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'top', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for refusing to reconcile with my neice?', 'updated_utc': 1554484275, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b7x6e4/aita_for_refusing_to_reconcile_with_my_neice/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

I said that was cool - I\\'d never met the friend. The friend was a childhood friend of the host\\'s.\\n\\nBefore the new guy comes, the host starts saying there wasn\\'t enough bedrooms for everyone. I asked him if the new guy could stay at a hotel or stay in the living room, since he basically invited himself. The host says \"I don\\'t really want to do that to guests\". I sense that he wants me to offer to leave my bedroom, cos he brings up the topic a few more times. His wife was also adamant to not sleep in the living room.\\n\\nI\\'ve always been taught that a host\\'s job is to make a guest as comfortable as possible. I\\'ve also been taught that a guest\\'s job is to make a host\\'s job as easy as possible - that\\'s called being a good guest.\\n\\nAs said, I decided to (somewhat begrudgingly) offer to sleep in the living room. The host immediately agrees, and says thank you.\\n\\nThe next day (before the guest arrived), the host asks me if everything is okay, and that he doesn\\'t want me to feel like I\\'m \"getting shafted\".

I share it with three roommates; we are all undergrads. I thought I wasn’t a part of the tension until now.\\n\\nOne of my roommates, H, has been sort of annoying about cleaning. She is a clean freak except doesn’t clean her stuff up to the same standard she holds others to. Stuff like leaving banana peels, dirty dishes, and other trash on the counter, but getting mad about the trash not being taken out or the floors not being swept. As a result, we’ve made a chore chart of sorts to determine who does what when. \\n\\nImportantly for this, I am almost never at the apartment except to sleep and shower, as I work 30 hours a week along with going to class. I pretty much never use dishes, and when I do I clean them up immediately. In the conversation with the chore chart, it was pointed out that this means I don’t have to do as much stuff in the kitchen, which was reflected in our chart. In this conversation it was also acknowledged that nobody had any problems with me.\\n\\nTonight, one of my roomies, B, sent a text in our groupchat (it’s hard for all of us to talk in person because of schedules) about laudry. It was a salty text, which I get because she works long hours and H is loud and wakes her up a lot. \\n\\nIn this conversation, I said if anyone has a grievance they should “call me out”. I meant this in the colloquial sense, but could have phrased it better.\\n\\nH took it literally. At the end of a message saying she wanted to work everything out and get rid of the tension, she says this: “also @(my name), if you could do the dishes or sweep or take out the trash every now and then that would help.” I took this as patronizing, as we had already discussed our roles regarding chores and I have been doing my jobs.\\n\\nI responded: “H, i understand your concern and will work to be better, however i’ve been following the chart for cleaning and i don’t even use dishes more than once every two weeks. i want to emphasize that i am just as invested as you all are in making sure there isn’t tension.  things have been really tense in the apartment lately and to be completely honest i’m kind of confused as to why. that being said, please tell me if you have anything you think i need to work on. however, H, i really don’t appreciate being literally @‘ed when it comes to something like this. i may be misinterpreting as it is easy to do via text, but that sounded super patronizing.” \\n\\nH gets offended by this and then says I shouldn’t be offended by communication when I just said I was open to being “called out”.  She then continued by saying that she doesn’t get what the big deal is and that she doesn’t feel comfortable in her own\\n\\n I’m upset because I wasn’t under the impression I had said anything wrong, but H’s response has me feeling like I have.

Except for one thing; he likes to smoke weed (often), and drink (rarely, doesn\\'t get drunk), while I have PTSD tied to the stuff because of some childhood trauma.\\n\\nTo explain the trauma, my mom was an abuser, who smoked cigarettes throughout my childhood and was a an alcoholic for a few years. Even worse than that I found out from my dad that she was actually an addict on a variety of other drugs my whole life and just hid it from me. And her boyfriend when I was in kindergarten, whom I loved dearly, died of lung cancer from secondhand smoke. She was the only smoker he knew. Basically, she *killed* him. And her ENTIRE side of the family smoked cigarettes too, and since I got dropped off at school and they smoked in their cars and home, I went to school smelling like smoke most days.\\n\\nNow to my boyfriend. One of the very reasons I even AGREED to go out with him is because he didn\\'t really plan to drink or smoke. This changed like three weeks into college. His friend convinced him to smoke weed, and then he just had to try alcohol too. I was like \"okay, don\\'t like this, but so long as he accommodates me, we\\'re good\". For awhile, I\\'ll admit I went too hard and wouldn\\'t let him even MENTION the stuff. By this point, I am chill with the mention of it. But now, he\\'ll try and get me to consider like, being around it, “to get over it\" sometimes, but does drop it when I say no. I know it\\'s a big part of his life, and where he met a lot of friends, but I just can\\'t even consider it. Like, when we went to his family\\'s Thanksgiving, EVERYONE was drinking heavily. And I was sitting on the edge of a panic attack the entire evening, unable to have fun. When he asked if he could have one drink, I felt like vomiting, and asked if he wouldn\\'t. Alcohol is a smaller trigger than smoke, so if I couldn\\'t handle that I couldn\\'t handle anything else.\\n\\nI know he just wants me to be involved in all parts of his life, and not being okay with this means I can\\'t meet all of his friends, but my trauma is so fresh because my sister is STIll suffering from the repercussions of substance abuse now, and I can\\'t do anything to help her. I have not made any attempt to try and stop him, because I know it is not my place. My boyfriend does everything responsibly and safely, so I trust him, but I\\'m not at a point in my life in which I can handle it. I love him, and we have almost no issues beyond this. He is not the bad guy here IMO, but my stance is that I\\'m not either.\\n\\n**TDLR; I can\\'t be around alcohol or any sort of drug that is smoked due to trauma that is still fresh, but my boyfriend who does those things wants me to be fully involved in his life.

My company rents anything from jackhammers and lawn mowers to giant boom lifts, and we also refill propane bottles. I\\'ve worked there for a few years now.\\n\\nI\\'ve been reported and shit-talked countless times because of my reputation as the jerkass service tech. I avoid ever dealing with customers directly unless I absolutely have to, and that\\'s because of every little OSHA and general common sense safety issues that customers constantly break either due to carelessness or ignorance. I\\'ve been written up more than a few times. This property that I work at has also seen quite a few property damage incidents and personal injury incidents due to both customer and employee carelessness.\\n\\nI almost blew up on a customer because they were smoking in their vehicle with their propane bottles open one time, and calmly but firmly explained that propane is explosive and that the customer could\\'ve gotten killed and injured or killed other people while on the property. Even reported it to my manager that the guy was doing that. But I got written up because I was \"rude.\" I never cursed and I never berated the customer, but because I deemed that a life-threatening situation I spoke with command. In my experience, people who already give no cares don\\'t actually listen to \"nice.\" I\\'ve tried it too many times before only to be ignored, so I dropped the sunshine and rainbows act entirely. \\n\\n\\nAnd it seems like the customers *do* listen to commands a lot more than they do when I treat them like royalty. \\n\\nOther examples include:  \\n\\n1 - directing people on where they can park/stand when things get busy and big company vehicles need to move around the property through command instead of request (I don\\'t care who has insurance and who\\'s liable, ***any*** collateral damage is a major pain in the ass to deal with)\\n\\n2 -  commanding people to leave designated \"employees only\" zones (OSHA violations galore if I don\\'t, and it\\'s not like any of the other employees on the property actually care to enforce any of the company rules) \\n\\n3 - firmly suggest that people keep the backs of their trucks/vans clear for equipment so that nobody gets hurt trying to load up equipment on an uneven pile of junk.\\n\\n4 - always (firmly and concisely) direct any customer who wanders into my workspace to go ask their questions to the people working in the office because they\\'re far more qualified to answer any equipment use-related questions than I am. I\\'m a service tech, so I work outside and perform maintenance on any machine scheduled for maintenance. I\\'ve never personally used any of the equipment. I\\'ve no experience in landscaping, carpentry, or anything like that - all I know is hardware and how to maintain it, so they\\'re trying to get blood from a stone regardless. \\n\\n5 - never humoring a customer with a propane refill on an expired bottle no matter how much they beg, because I\\'ll always be liable if something *does* happen during or after I fill the expired bottle \\n\\n\\nOne may think that these situations are rare, but they\\'re not, even with every effort to not be around customers. But, every so often the property gets busy to the point where I have to be pulled out of my workspace to go help the yard workers, and that\\'s when I get to see the kind of people that make up the clientele. \\n\\nMind you, I don\\'t curse out customers, I don\\'t mock or berate them either. I\\'m also not nice. I don\\'t make requests, I issue orders, and that\\'s because due to past experiences I want to leave as little room for error and incident as possible.

This gas station usually plays host to a group of older men in the mornings who like to come play cribbage and drink coffee that the management gives them for free.\\n\\nOne  particular man, who for the rest of the post will be referred to as M,  has never worked for our location, nor any other location in our chain. However, He constantly speaks to myself and the other younger  members of our staff as though he is our supervisor. When he isn\\'t doing  this, he is simply making rude or snide comments about us either  directly to us or to the others in his group.\\n\\nSimply put, M comes in every day, and after he\\'s done with cribbage, fills our coolers if something is low. He has to go back into what would normally be employee only areas to do this most of the time, and is very nasty to the rest of the staff about it.\\n\\nWith  all the context out of the way, I go in to work one day to find that the general manager had  to come in to cover the morning shift.  We switch tills, and while the GM is  going back to take midday count of her till and our slot machine payout  funds, M comes up to me and tells me, word for word, \"Now I went around  and filled up all those coolers, and they\\'d BETTER look like that when I  come in in the morning.\"\\n\\nFrustrated, I  go to the GM and essentially  said that I\\'m sick of M speaking to me like he\\'s my boss, and that he  shouldn\\'t really be doing anything that he does around here in the first  place, even if it can be helpful sometimes. My boss, likely frustrated  already considering she shouldn\\'t have had to be there that day, told me  that she was thrust into that shift, and that they were swamped in the  morning, so he was just helping her out. I told him what he had said to  me and she told me, quote, \"It\\'s not always about you. And sometimes  people on the night shift, not you, but people on the night shift leave  the coolers empty. Ron\\'s just being helpful so you\\'ll just have to learn  to ignore him.\" I decided not to press further after that, frustrated.\\n\\nWithin this statement,  there\\'s the implication that I, as practically the only night shift  worker we have, do not fill the coolers properly at night. I fill the  coolers to the point where they look full every night before I leave,  but if there are three or more bottle in a row, or the cans/bottles are  large and bulky like Arizona tea cans or tall 38 oz cans, I typically  leave them. I also don\\'t fill the rows completely, because as stated  above, pushing the bottles/cans all the way to the back results in them  falling behind the shelves entirely, or makes the more top heavy bottles  fall over and out of the coolers when they\\'re meant to slide down.\\n\\nSo  Long Story short, I think M should be asked not to return to the store.

We had been together for 10 years and she walked out of our home the night she admitted her affair to me and left. This blindsided me so it's been pretty rough for me to accept, I was hoping she would at least try some marriage counselling or try and figure out what went wrong before I made a decision on if we should part ways but she wasn't interested and basically told me in no uncertain terms we would never get back together and to give up any hope of that. She is still with this guy today.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo around this time last year, before the cheating was revealed, 2 of our closer friends invited us to their wedding, my wife is best friends with the Bride I was invited to be a Groomsman by the Groom and happily accepted. When we first broke up, I was talking to the Groom and pointed out that the wedding was going to be an issue, in my experience the bridal party are introduced to a song (we had picked our wedding song), dance together etc. He agreed and said he would actually understand if I couldn't go, but that I should definitely go to his bucks–a week long overseas trip. In January the Bride had her birthday and didn't invite me or mention anything, which kind of hurt. I put that aside and went to the bucks recently, had a good time with the buck.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOn the weekend it was time to RSVP for the wedding and I'd been changing my mind back and forth often and thought maybe it was best if I avoided it all-together. The few times I've seen my ex when she has come to our house to pack her things, take the dog etc, I've found it really difficult to be around her so I've been avoiding any contact and removed her from social media to try and focus on moving on. I tried to call the groom to ask if my ex would be bringing her affair partner and to see what expectations there are for the bridal party. He didn't answer his phone so I sent a message basically saying that I regrettably won't be attending because of the situation with my ex-wife. In hindsight I probably should have kept trying to call him but I was really anxious about the call in the first place and just wanted it to be dealt with so I could try and relax. I haven't got a reply from him in 24 hours and I've tried to ring him several times today but he isn't answering, which is a bit unusual for him. I just wanted to say that maybe I panicked a bit sending the text message off and perhaps I could go to the ceremony as a regular non bridal party member and that would make things a bit more bearable for me in terms of being around my ex-wife.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI just feel awful about it, I thought he would understand but maybe after all this time he forgot that he said he would understand if I didn't come, or figured I would've said something sooner.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAITA here or am I overthinking this?

I did tell her I broke up with my girlfriend over a month ago because the first time we met she mentioned that she doesnt get involved with people who just broke up with thier SOs.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe only spent breaks together but she was home for 2 months due to and internship and getting time off school. So we saw eachother alot. When she was gone we texted and I said I missed you a couple times. We definantly texted alot and I called her when things where going bad for her at college. Everytime she was gone we would text everyday, tell eachother I miss you and talked about how excited we where to see eachother. I knew she was seeing other people, she even texted them when we hung out She apparently had an std scare when a partners condom broke, and she called me right away. One time I knew she had sex with another person that day and came over 4 hours later.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nA couple weeks ago D suddenly texted me asking were we where going and that we have been kinda acting like more then fwbs? D then told me that if I wasnt going to date her eventually then she didnt want to be involved much longer. I told D that my depression was bad so I cant really make that decision. I thanked her for coming over and helping me multiple times and picking me up from work. She then told me that she\\'ll keep seeing me but if Im not going to commit then she is going to keep seeing other people. D tells me to tell her if im not interested anymore or are seeing other people.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nD\\'s spring break comes along and we text how excited we are to meet again, but after the first day. I dont want to see her. My anxiety starts to act up and I just stop opening her snaps. D eventaully contacts me on facebook saying \"Hey I thought you where above ghosting me? Youre clearly active on snapchat but not opening my messages? I thought you wanted to see me over break?\" So I tell her I never wanted to be with her and that Im too depressed to think about being in a relationship and that her pushing me made me uncomfortable. Then I blocked her, except she saw my insta post with my new girlfriend 4 days after the conversation. She sent me angry messages calling me a liar, and saying I never respected her. I told her that she was gross for sleeping with someone else the same day she came to see me and that she cant be mad I dont have feelings for her. She responded by calling me a coward that lead her on and slut shamed her.

I live in a small rural college town in a one bedroom apartment with my \"friend.\" From the very beginning I said I didn\\'t think either of us could ever say that each other couldn\\'t have people over and agreed that we wouldn\\'t have people over at unreasonable times. That being said I also asked that he tell me if he\\'s having people over and he agreed. \\n\\nRoughly 8 months and one break up later an additional rule is that my ex can under no circumstances be at the apartment. (Things didn\\'t end that bed, just rough emotionally on me, but roommate is still friends with her.) My roommate has since been super weird about people coming over, sometimes telling me, and sometimes not saying anything until he finds out I\\'m coming home or he tells me right before he knows I\\'m on my way. This isn\\'t just frustrating because he blatantly ignores my (imho) very simple courtesy request, but also because of the way he sneaks around it. He\\'ll text me to ask when I\\'m home, like tonight for example. I was on my way back from out of town and was supposed to arrive around six. I got invited to hang out with a friend and I texted my roommate to tell him I\\'d be back at closer to midnight. As I\\'m scrolling through my social media feed I see that he has people at the house. I decide it can wait and don\\'t say anything. At 11:30 he asks if I\\'ll be home soon. I reply\\n\\n\"Probably, btw i really don\\'t apparently you not telling me you\\'re having people over. We\\'ve talked about this multiple times\"\\n\\n*Seen*\\n\\n\"Seriously it\\'s not that hard to text me, for instance, instead of asking when I\\'ll be back so you\\'ll know whether or not I\\'ll come back while they\\'re there friggin just tell me you\\'re having people over\"\\n\\n*Seen*\\n\\nWhen I come home he\\'s on his computer and I have some small talk and start unpacking my stuff. As I set up my desk I notice that my bag of little popper things which was full, is now almost empty. I ask him about it as he pops into a call and he says that they used a few (they used like 3/4 of the bag) I tell him how rude that is and he avoids eye contact and says he\\'ll buy me more. I tell him that\\'s not what it\\'s about it\\'s about the blatantly lack of respect for me. I bring up the having people over and he basically blows me off. I just don\\'t even know what to say to him. He\\'s so apathetic it\\'s extremely frustrating and makes me wonder if I\\'m being ridiculous. \\n\\nSorry for being so wordy, looking forward to a verdict.', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 616690, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'top', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for being frustrated that my roommate has people over without telling me?', 'updated_utc': 1554485274, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b7y6ju/aita_for_being_frustrated_that_my_roommate_has/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

My company rents anything from jackhammers and lawn mowers to giant boom lifts, and we also refill propane bottles. I\\'ve worked there for a few years now. I\\'m a service tech, but I\\'ll often be pulled out of my station to help the yard workers with fulfilling rental orders. \\n\\nI\\'ve been reported and shit-talked countless times because of my reputation as the jerkass service tech. I avoid ever dealing with customers directly unless I absolutely have to, and that\\'s because of every little OSHA and general common sense safety issues that customers constantly break either due to carelessness or ignorance. I\\'ve been written up more than a few times. This property that I work at has also seen quite a few property damage incidents and personal injury incidents due to both customer and employee carelessness.\\n\\nMy motto is to never be mean and nasty, to never mock or berate a customer or co-worker, but also not to request but to command. Lastly, aim to keep all interaction as short as possible. Through my years of being in the workforce, I\\'ve been largely ignored or not taken seriously when I am being nice and courteous when I requested things from my customers. Issuing commands has worked out in keeping the property damage and injury down, at a cost.\\n\\nI almost blew up on a customer because they were smoking in their vehicle with their propane bottles open one time, and calmly but firmly explained that propane is explosive and that the customer could\\'ve gotten killed and injured or killed other people while on the property. Even reported it to my manager that the guy was doing that. But I got written up because I was \"rude.\" I never cursed and I never berated the customer, but because I deemed that a life-threatening situation I spoke with command. \\n\\nIn response to a plethora of incidents, I now:\\n\\n1 - direct people on where they can park/stand when things get busy and big company vehicles need to move around the property through command instead of request (I don\\'t care who has insurance and who\\'s liable, any collateral damage is a major pain in the ass to deal with)\\n\\n2 - command people to leave designated \"employees only\" zones (OSHA violations galore if I don\\'t, and it\\'s not like any of the other employees on the property actually care to enforce any of the company rules)\\n\\n3 - firmly suggest that people keep the backs of their trucks/vans clear for equipment so that nobody gets hurt trying to load up equipment on an uneven pile of junk.\\n\\n4 - always (firmly and concisely) direct any customer who wanders into my workspace (without crossing the employees only line) to go ask their questions to the people working in the office because they\\'re far more qualified to answer any equipment use-related questions than I am. I have no real work experience in using any of the equipment anyway, so I\\'m useless to them.

She then started seeing me. I did tell her I broke up with my girlfriend over a month ago because the first time we met she mentioned that she doesnt get involved with people who just broke up with thier SOs.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe only spent breaks together but she was home for 2 months due to and internship and getting time off school. So we saw eachother alot. When she was gone we texted and I said I missed you a couple times. We definantly texted alot and I called her when things where going bad for her at college. Everytime she was gone we would text everyday, tell eachother I miss you and talked about how excited we where to see eachother. I knew she was seeing other people, she even texted them when we hung out She apparently had an std scare when a partners condom broke, and she called me right away. One time I knew she had sex with another person that day and came over 4 hours later.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nA couple weeks ago D suddenly texted me asking were we where going and that we have been kinda acting like more then fwbs? D then told me that if I wasnt going to date her eventually then she didnt want to be involved much longer. I told D that my depression was bad so I cant really make that decision. I thanked her for coming over and helping me multiple times and picking me up from work. She then told me that she\\'ll keep seeing me but if Im not going to commit then she is going to keep seeing other people. D tells me to tell her if im not interested anymore or are seeing other people.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nD\\'s spring break comes along and we text how excited we are to meet again, but after the first day. I dont want to see her. My anxiety acts up so I just stop opening her snaps. D  contacts me on facebook saying \"Why are you ghosting me? Youre active on snapchat but not opening my messages? I thought you wanted to see me over break?\" So I tell her I never wanted to be with her and that Im too depressed to think about being in a relationship and that her pushing made me uncomfortable. Then I blocked her. She saw my post with my new girlfriend 4 days after we talked. She sent me messages calling me a liar, and saying I never respected her. I told her that she was gross for sleeping with someone else the same day she came to see me and that she cant be mad I dont have feelings for her. She responded by calling me a coward that lead her on and slut shamed her.

I try initiating sex and get brutally turned down, we move past it though, get brunch and I head off to work.\\n\\nFast forward to that evening. I had met up with a few friends to kill time and asked him to meet us for dinner, wanting him to meet my friends and spend time. He was excited about it, but as soon as we started making our way back to his place we got into a huge fight about nothing, and how i was really annoying him. Finally got back to his place, thought things cooled off as we were laughing and cuddling, so again tried to have sex and got told that no means no and he just wasn’t in the mood. Alright. went to bed. \\n\\nFriday morning we’re laying in bed talking about getting groceries to make breakfast, he keeps making jokes about his dick and how i accidentally touched it and so i was like ok...this has gotta be it. rejected. again. told i was aggressive and pushy and that i need to get people in the mood. this devolves into me being told that i should have just dropped it and laughed it off and instead i should leave and possibly stay at my friends for the night. I left for the day to give him space / i had to work, and then he called a few hours later wanting to meet for dinner. great! we’re near by and went for a couples dinner and had a fun time. after leaving, we all agreed to get another drink and go home, but suddenly he gets a phone call and they talk about going out, so as soon as we get to the bar, he says he wants to go home. no invite for me, just that he is going home.\\nI was hurt and texted him as such that i wanted to spend time, and he said that he thought me coming over was implied. \\n\\nFinally saturday, i reach out early in the morning to spend the day, he can’t spend any of the afternoon/ morning with me but we can do dinner. I’m super excited, yes, let’s do a 1:1 dinner tonight. Around 5 he confirms the time, and then an hour later says he needs to get sushi with his friends, and that I’m welcome to meet him for a drink after if i’m up to it. He then calls at 11:30pm saying he’s tired. meanwhile all of my clothes are still at his house- i’ve been wearing the same outfit for 2 days-\\n\\nthe last day rolls around- sunday. I call because i’m leaving that day, and need my things. I come to his apartment and ask to talk for 5 minutes to end things on a better note, and he acts like he’s doing me a favor by talking to me, saying i’m incredibly confrontational, and if i had just walked in here with a good attitude, we could have gone for coffee and had a fun afternoon. \\n\\nI’m probably forgetting things, but i just need to know, AITA?

I'm sorry.\\n\\nSo context: I'm a 19yo girl from Chile in a Long distance relationship with my 18yo boyfriend from America. We've known each other for three years and dated for one.\\nI'm studying animation and my plan has always been moving to America after I graduate but then the plans changed. My dad offered me to move to USA for College and studying animation. Well, honestly I would have said no if it wasn't because of my boyfriend. I'm really close with my family and have a real problem with being alone, plus the money that I't will cost to move right now, the formalities and the language. But I said yes because of him.\\nI wanted to go to Florida because it had good colleges in animation and It wasn't that expensive but my boyfriend told me that it would be more convenient if we both moved to California (He's from NC) where there are a lot of good animation colleges too and the college he wanted to go. I agreed.\\nSeeing that it wasn't that convenient as in finances we started to get a little concerned about the whole thing and if it was worth it going to live together in a state that expensive. I've always told him that he doesn't have to tie his future to me. If he finds something convenient out of California or Florida he should go and I wouldn't mind. That's when he offered me going to NC. I denied saying that It wasn't convenient for me for the area I wanted to study in. He got mad and sad saying I shouldn't have ditched the idea so easily and quickly giving the fact that he had been investing and thinking a lot on how we could be in the same state. How he was willing to go to any state for me but I wasn't. I told him the truth, I didn't wanted to waste the fact that I was moving from one side of the continent to the other for something that wasn't worth it academically. He got rightfully offended and sad, and angry, and after a long conversation he said that he was going to be honest too.

There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

Long story short, we began flirting and I asked her to the ball. We were beginning to get to that \"more than friends\" when I realised that she\\'s very clingy, not really what I look for in a relationship. So I told her that I\\'d be better off with her as friends and that I\\'d still like to go to the ball with her as mates, but then stuff got even worse. \\n\\nAbout two weeks ago, I was having shit time as I had lost a friend of in the Christchurch terror attacks.  She fully what I was going through. she sort of just ignored it and sent memes about the topic which I found pretty offensive. As a result I told her I was upset (not about what tho) and just started sort of easing off contact with her - not replying to her messages etc. Around about this time she also told me about how much she liked me and how she wished we were more than friends and could be together and all that.  Remember that clingy part I said? Yeah, that came out full force. She messaged me on snapchat, text, Facebook messenger, both my instagram accounts, created a post on Facebook that only her and I could see and said to talk to her. After all this had failed she emailed me which I just ignored again because I really wasnt in the mood. I began to notice how she was low key very very VERY obsessive with me responding. \\n\\nI\\'m a pretty laid back guy, so all considered I decided that i didnt think it was a good idea for me to go to the ball with her as we\\'d we would ruin it for each other, which I didn\\'t know when I asked her as I hadnt gotten to know her properly. But obviously saying that I didn\\'t want to go to the ball with her because she was over attached would be a huge dick move so I wasnt going to say that, so I thought that I\\'d just go along with it - I\\'ve made my bed, so I should sleep in it I thought. But then she kept telling me how much she liked me, but then she had sex with another guy and told me again that she liked me. At this point I was sort of just confused, and I didn\\'t want to go to the ball with her so I said that, but instead of telling the truth I said that I felt manipulated and hurt when she had sex with another dude after saying she was head over heels obsessed with me and that I don\\'t think it would be a good idea to go together, because I dislike hurting peoples feelings more than necessary but still, that would not have been fun to hear and I sorta regret it because she is really sad now and angry at me. At the same time, I don\\'t think it\\'s fair for me to put up with her ruining my best memory of my last year of school, especially after she memed something very close to me and sort of creeped me out with the obsessive messaging. \\n\\nAm I the asshole?

Obviously this is something that I VERY strongly disagree with — not only because foregoing vaccinations can severely endanger the public but also because it’s a pretty damn personal topic. My brother is autistic, and the conspiracy theory that vaccinations cause autism hurts him deeply (undeniably disproven, as I’m sure I don’t have to say to fellow Redditors). It hurts me, too — he’s my brother, and I feel like society has failed him and people like him by allowing this anti-vax mindfuck to take hold. When the opportunity presents itself, I’ll never stop trying to convince others that A) vaccines do NOT cause autism; and B) the argument that autism is worse than polio/smallpox/other disfiguring or fatal diseases is pretty fucked up anyway.\\n\\nMy boyfriend’s parents know this very well. They know my brother, having lived in the same small town, and they know my stance. We’re all usually very careful to avoid the topic, as we know that it wouldn’t generate critical discussion or change anyone’s mind.\\n\\nThat said, though, something was different tonight. My boyfriend’s dad started to toe the line at dinner together. We were all there: me and my boyfriend, my boyfriend’s sibling, his mom, and his dad. It was out of the blue. My boyfriend’s dad and sibling had a LONG conversation about how we shouldn’t trust conventional medicine, how vaccines have unknown and harmful chemicals, how they don’t work, how it’s a way to brainwash the masses, etc. etc. etc. It’s important to understand that they were toeing the line — making their beliefs clear but not necessarily being rude about it. \\n\\nEven so, like I said: this shit grinds my gears. They’ve known in the past to skirt the subject around me for the reasons mentioned above. I was pissed. By this point, my boyfriend’s dad and sibling had quieted and were drinking beer, clearly signalling that they were ready to talk about other things, but I couldn’t just let them say this asinine shit unchallenged. So I took it to the next level. I wanted to argue — I can’t honestly say I thought I could truly change their minds. I told them their beliefs were straight-up bullshit and they couldn’t rely on evidence that literally did not exist. I argued with his dad mostly and things heated up. He had to be the one to stop the conversation and walk away.\\n\\nTL;DR: Escalated an argument with my boyfriend’s anti-vax parents even though I knew they’d never change their minds. \\n\\nAside: my boyfriend had his vaccinations as an adult and chose not to verbally engage with the conversation, though was supportive while I argued with his dad — putting his arm around me, squeezing my knee, etc.\\n\\nLike I said, this is too close for me to objectively check my behaviour, so I’d like to see what you all think.

Not sure its the same in America as you can't go nightclubs until you're 21.\\n\\nAnyway, a bit about myself. I am 6''1 and dress really well. I don't consider myself ''traditionally good looking''. I feel that I have to really put some major effort to look decent, so I put a lot of effort into quiffing my hair, smelling good and dressing well. If I don't do this, I don't think I look good at all. I generally did follow the advice I got on the internet (be as physically fit as possible and look your best; grooming, hair, clothes, smell, etc). Also not sure if my race is relevant, but to give as much background and context possible, I am quite light brown skinned (half Punjabi Indian/half Tamil Indian).\\n\\nSo, me and my friend (also 20M) went to this pre-drinks and while I was there I was talking with everyone and my friend comes up to me and he can't stop laughing. I ask him ''What's up?'' and he said ''That black girl over there said you must be gay''.\\n\\nI felt so furious when that happened, I dressed well to attract girls, and now one of them thought I was gay. Given that I was a bit drunk as well, I instantly approached her and said ''What the fuck did you say to me??'' and she said ''Huh??'' and I said ''You fucking called me gay? How dare you say shit like that. I'm not gay'' and she looks quite scared and starts saying ''Sorry sorry, I didn't mean it honestly I was just curious I'm sorry'' and she looked a bit intimidated. I said ''Good'' and walked off and continued with my night.\\n\\nNow I've seen that girl again, and every time I see her, she always makes a point to say ''Hi throwawaykljfslk'' but she says it in a scared sort of way.

He has always been kind of a dick to me but this specific time was my tipping point. We were all drinking, having fun. HE brings up race/white privilege and I welcome the discussion because as a grad student in cultural studies, I study/talk about this shit all the time. Fine. He fancies himself the “devils advocate” in any and all situations. Things get intense and just in time, a friend shows up and he has to get up to grab the door. As he does so, he makes some drunken comment to his friend about me along the lines of “She always says stupid shit and pretends to know what she’s saying” when asked about why we were shouting as they approached the door. This does it for me and I tell him to fuck off, and I go to the guest room to cool off. \\n\\nI overhear him talking shit about me to his friend, talking about how “he didn’t even try that hard and my whole snowflake worldview came crashing down.” “He has to handle me with baby gloves,” etc. literally nobody else agrees with him, and I come out and mention that I don’t care about the discussion about race because I have them all the time...but I don’t appreciate being belittled. This makes him laugh and continue to be a dick, so I go back to the guest room and that was that. \\n\\nNow my question is not necessarily about him; most people agree that he’s an asshole...I am mainly concerned with my sister, who is frustrated because I’ve actively avoided him since this event. I understand that she doesn’t want to pick sides between her husband and her sister, and she is the type of person who just wants harmony with everyone. But her husband adds nothing to my life but frustration and I don’t feel like I owe her any more attempts to hang out with them both (this is not the first time he’s been rude to me/we’ve gotten in a big fight). \\n\\nSo, two weeks ago we happened to be in Virginia at the same time randomly (we live in separate states.) she suggested they drive to where my partner and I were on a Sunday because her husband had the day off (he was there for work). I told her the truth, which was that my partner and I wanted alone time. She ended up coming on Monday alone, and she confronted me about why I have been avoiding her husband. When I told her I had no interest in being associated with him she got really upset, and I told her I’d try one more time to hang out with him. But I REALLY want to take that back now because just the thought of interacting with him again gives me anxiety. She wants to bring him to my graduation in May and I don’t want him there. \\nAITA if I go back on my word?\\n\\nThanks in advance. \\n\\n', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 617020, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'top', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for not wanting to associate with my brother in law?', 'updated_utc': 1554486712, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b7zi6o/aita_for_not_wanting_to_associate_with_my_brother/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

I've never had any real association with her and wouldn't have talked to her once if it wasn't for the fact that I catch the ferry with her. I'm generally pretty polite to her and just talk about small talk and usually, we just have conversations with the other people I sit with on the ferry (Liv and Coco). \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI always like to avoid disliking people, it takes up to much time and effort and doesn't get anyone anywhere, but Lexi has a special place in my heart. When I first met Lexi I had no issues with her at all but soon she'd barely ever acknowledge me in conversations. Either way, no biggie. Then there was 'the ferry order'. Lexi really didn't want me to sit next to her so she silently made a seating arrangement. Even though Coco gets on after me, Lexi is always sitting next to Liv and Coco and away from me. Again I just put up with it. That was until one day I just sat where I wanted. I guess that one day was too hard for Lexi so she decided from then on we'd all stand up she wouldn't sit next to me. It was soon I found out that she talked sooo much shit about me behind my back, about just how much she hated me. For what I'll never know. For asking her how her weekend was? She continued to ignore me and chat shit for however long as well as some new mean comments among other things.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis is when the perfect opportunity for payback comes around.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOne day we're on the ferry and I'm talking about the people I'm doing a play with (I go to a girls school and this is a thing with the brother school). I'm talking about the play when I mention a dude, Knox, who is really popular. He's a nice dude. At the mention of his name, she says eww. So later that day at rehearsals I asked Knox if he knows Lexi and he says he's never heard of her. He asks me why I'm asking and I explain so he looks up her insta. We kinda joke around and he's like '800 followers and she only follows 300 back! Wow, that's real low. One post! Pfft. And it's captioned tomato twins, what does that even mean?' So he asks me if I like her and I explain and he says let's just have a chat with Lexi. He just sent hi. She responds with hi and leaves her on read for a week. Turns out that week she's been proudly telling everyone that she thinks Knox likes her so she seems popular. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAt first I wanted to embarrass her in front of everyone she told, but then I thought I would just tell her on the ferry but some of my friends say this would be too mean. Liv and Coco say it would ruin her if I tell her because it's coming from me, the person she thinks so low of, and say I should do it. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR; Some girl acts like a bitch to me unprovoked and now's my chance for payback but I don't know if I'll be like her.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWIBTA if I told her about what happened instead of just leaving it, even if it's on the ferry with just Coco and Liv?\", 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 617115, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'top', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'WIBTA if I gave a bully a taste of their own medicine?', 'updated_utc': 1554487220, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b7zw3g/wibta_if_i_gave_a_bully_a_taste_of_their_own/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

She told me she still had feelings for me and told me again that she didn\\'t want to date because of her feelings towards Alex. Today I woke up to a message from her. It was a screenshot showing Alex asking B out. I flipped it and told her to fuck off and just stop talking to me.

The guy who checked in just before 2 talked about leaving at 5 for work, so when I got a phone call at 5 from a guest who wanted their money back, I assumed it was him.\\n\\nThis guy said he had checked in just before 2, he was unhappy with the room, he said the TV didn\\'t work, the bed and pillows were super uncomfortable, and the fridge was loud and he hadn\\'t managed to get any sleep. I told him the only way I could do a refund was if he checked out right away, and he agreed.\\n\\nI had been away from the desk and when I got back I saw the name on the caller ID was not in fact the guest I had checked in but a different one. Someone who had checked in at 10:30. I considered honoring the refund to save face, but at the same time, 6 hours in a room where you\\'re apparently miserable is a bit much.\\n\\nI explained the misunderstanding to the man, who did not take it well. Apparently I had misheard the time he told me he had arrived, and he in turn had been mistaken about the time. Still, I told him that because of how long he had been at the hotel, and had not previously reported the issues (that I could have easily fixed by moving him to another room) I could only offer a small discount.\\n\\nHe didn\\'t like this answer, saying that how was he supposed to know that was all he had to do, and how was he supposed to know a new room wouldn\\'t be worse or the same? I likened it to ordering food at a restaurant. You can\\'t clean your plate then say it was bad or wrong and demand a refund or hefty discount (I mean some places you can, but that\\'s not the point).\\n\\nHe wanted to talk to a manager. It being 5 am, and the hotel being small, the manager was not in. I told him he would have to call back later when the manager was in. He didn\\'t like this answer, demanding that I **immediately** call the manager. My rule of thumb is I don\\'t wake up the manager unless it\\'s an emergency.\\n\\nBut wanting a refund or big discount is not an emergency. If you want that, you can talk to him during office hours.\\n\\nWe did this whole thing back and forth and round in circles for about ten minutes.

I was a approached by a very drunk women who was a lot of fun to talk to and very attractive. After a while she became very flirty and kept taking my hand in hers. Her friends definitely started trying to set us up but I pointed out it was probably a bad idea due to the big difference in soberness, I had only had one pint as this all happened fairly quickly. I basically never get hit on but I enjoyed chatting with her so much I at least wanted become friends. Her friends seemed to ditch us at some point.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nEventually she said needed to get to get home as she had work tomorrow but asked me to put my number in her phone. As I was worried about her walking around alone so drunk I offered to make sure she gets home which she accepts. On the way to my car she stopped and looking serious asked if I was safe to which I said I like to think so. She stared into my eyes kind of awkwardly and forced a deep kiss on me which felt so good I just kind of let it happen. Then she said she could probably beat me in a fight anyway, she is probably right.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe get to hers and she invites me in saying its late. I accept but say although I really like her I am not comfortable getting frisky to which she accepts. We chat in her kitchen for a bit before heading to bed. While I use the loo quickly first I come back to find her under the sheets already. I turn the lights off and get in. At this point she wraps her arms around me and I realise she has completely undressed.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI try to get to sleep but she starts to finger herself. She kisses me and then pulls my cock out of my boxers and starts to jerk me off. I decide I try to help her get off and start to finger her. Then she pulls me closer and tells me to fuck her. I make one last comment that I am not really comfortable with this but she says she needs to feel me inside of her which was about all my brain could take so I move in. We have probably the best sex I have had, though there aren't many contenders.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIn the morning we both wake up early, make out a bit and chat, mostly us laughing about things that happened when I confirm events and fill in the blanks of her evening. I explain that I feel bad about the sex but she says not to worry, that she hasn't slept with a guy in over a year and really needed a fuck. That she was glad it was someone like me. We discuss meeting up again and confirm we have contact details for each other. I drive her to work and she kisses me goodbye. Only an hour or so later she is texting me and we text back and forth throughout the day.  \\n\\n\\nI feel like I have betrayed any morals I had by sleeping with someone so shit-faced when I was practically sober. I think I basically let the whole thing play out despite knowing  that if I went anywhere near her home that the night would likely end in sex.  \\n\\n\\nSo am I an arsehole or just overthinking this?\", 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 617324, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'thumbnail': 'nsfw', 'title': 'AITA Consent when drunk initiates', 'updated_utc': 1554488030, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b80ria/aita_consent_when_drunk_initiates/', 'whitelist_status': 'promo_adult_nsfw', 'wls': 3}\n",

The cycle has finished, but the owner of the clothes hasn\\'t taken them out yet. So I carefully take out their clothes and place them on a counter in the middle of the room to make room for my clothes.\\n\\nI didn\\'t think much of this, but apparently I may have broken some unspoken rule of laundry etiquette. One time I did this, I got a note in my laundry saying that I should have just waited because I \"moved someone\\'s laundry out not even 10 minutes after their load was done.\"\\n\\nMaybe they didn\\'t like that I had my greasy hands all over their clothes? That I could have accidentally dropped a sock of theirs and lost it?\\n\\nBut my thought is that if you\\'re in a shared laundry room, it\\'s your responsibility to take your clothes out promptly. It tells you how long it takes: 30-35 minutes for the washer and 40-45 minutes for the dryer. You can set a timer. If you\\'re not moving your laundry, you shouldn\\'t be surprised when somebody else moves it for you. Other people need to use the machines.\\n\\nA second event happened last night though that inspired me to make this post. I was about to wash my bedsheets in the evening. One of the washers was still going, and the other was full of clothes, but the cycle was finished. Keeping in mind that note I got before, I decided to maybe give it the benefit of the doubt and heed its advice. So I left back to my room, waited 15 minutes, and came back. The clothes were still there. I had given them a grace period, so I took their clothes out and put them to the side. I continued on with my day and switched my laundry to the dryer after it was done washing. Then when I came back to pick up my dry clothes, I realized that this other person took my clothes out of the dryer, probably pretty close to when I put them in because they were still completely wet, and used my wash cycle, which I paid for, to dry their clothes. There was an empty dryer right next to mine, so this was clearly an intentional act of revenge. I had to pay another $1.50 to redo the load that they stole and also waste 45 minutes of my time. I had to get up early the next day for a class I have, and these were my bedsheets, so this person cost me 45 minutes of sleep. And when I came back to pick up my dry clothes after the second time around, they still had not picked up their dry clothes over 45 minutes after they finished drying.\\n\\nPersonally I don\\'t think there\\'s any ambiguity over whether this person is an asshole, but they clearly had a reason to do it. I just wanted to highlight the fact that people are out there who are upset by my actions.

My parents relationship was becoming more and more strained with my dad working really hard at his marketing job and my mom just worked whenever she wanted to (which wasn\\'t often). My mother was getting paranoid that my father was cheating on her. He honestly never had time for \"another family\" nor did he even have time for all the stress my mother was putting him under.  Finally it came to a point here she was screaming at him over her missing tupperware and asked for a divorce that night. My dad was tired of all the yelling and fighting over the past two years so he just agreed - which seemed to surprise my mother. The following months ensued and my mother spoke to anyone that would lend an ear that she was going to milk my dad for all his money and make his life a living hell - which she had also told me several times so I decided to record her. She would tell me stories that my dad would beat me and that I just don\\'t remember because I\\'m trying to suck up to my dad. Which was ironic because my mother was the one who would assault and belittle me all my life (even going as far as to scream and hit me while we were having dinner in public). Let\\'s just say my dad was none too happy when I played the recording for him. Things seemed to die down from there and my parents were going back and forth through court for hearings. I was working at a telephone company and was overall just ignoring what was going on. I was called to my boss\\' office one day and was surprised at what she had to say. (this boss is like an Auntie to me all my life growing up) My mom had apparently messaged her husband on facebook, telling him that \"Your wife is a fucking whore and I bet she likes fucking my husband since she likes all his posts (on facebook). Just thought I\\'d tell you.\" My boss didn\\'t care about what my mother wrote - she was more concerned about me and my brother. I left work early to confront my mother. I asked her not to do something like that ever again and that I was disgusted by it. My mother was mad that I didn\\'t stand up for her and call my boss a whore and quit. I knew I wasn\\'t getting to her and just left. Now, I have a Whatsapp chat with my brother. I plan with my brother to take him out and go buy games. I would tell my brother sometimes through these chats not to tell my mom that I\\'m getting him video games or taking him out to hang out. Then one day my mom made my brother log into his Whatsapp account and she read everything. She blew me up to tell me to come to her house so she can smack me around.

The major players here are my father, his mother (my grandmother/my mother\\'s MIL,) and my mother. \\n\\nSeveral years ago, my father had an affair. My mother found out about it and confided in my grandmother (my father\\'s mother) who told her \"Oh grow up, everyone has affairs.\" A little while later, my father announced he wanted a divorce. It came out later that his mother had encouraged him to do this.\\n\\nStill, despite knowing all this, my mother wanted to continue having a relationship with my grandmother. She asked her at one point \"Do you still love me even though your son divorced me?\" and my grandmother said \"Well, I love you as best I can.\"\\n\\nFast forward to now. I have had a contentious relationship with my father since my early teens and have been no contact with him since June 2016, for reasons totally unrelated to all the previously mentioned drama. In February 2018 I got engaged and asked my grandmother if she would still come to the wedding even if I didn\\'t invite my dad, and she said \"yes, of course.\" My fiancé and I decided on our date and after much painful consideration and flip-flopping back and forth, I finally decided I definitely did not want my father at our wedding. I informed my father of this and he responded in a generally positive tone, saying he understood where I was coming from and hoped we could work on things in the future. \\n\\nThen, my grandmother sent me a long email about how upsetting it was for *her* to hear that I had not invited my dad, that *she* would find it heart-wrenching to attend a wedding where the bride\\'s father was not present, and so, because of my decision, she was declining to attend the wedding. I was pretty shocked by this and still feel very hurt. She sent me this email on Valentine\\'s Day and has not said a word to me since, until...\\n\\nLast week, my fiancé and I had to put down our dog. I texted my grandmother to ask if we could scatter his ashes at her lake house, since our dog loved roaming the woods around that house. She informed me that her other son (my uncle) and her brother/his wife (my great-uncle and great-aunt) were coming to town but that they would be gone in two weeks, so I could bring the ashes down after that. So basically, she was treating me like a pariah and excluding me from spending time with my own family -- all because I set my own boundaries when it came to the guests at my own wedding.\\n\\nNow, the present issue is that my mother, despite all of this, still continues to seek a relationship with my grandmother. I haven\\'t said anything about it to my mom, but every time I hear that my mom is going to an event with my grandmother, or going to an event in support of my grandmother, I feel hurt and do not feel supported at all.

He aims to be in bed by 9. \\n\\n2 months ago I spent a month going to bed at 8 so we could have a bit of a snuggle before bed. For that whole month I would make sure I was in bed early and he would just continue to do his own thing (video games, phone games etc) until he was ready and this started stretching past his 9pm bedtime. Sometimes I would even fall asleep before he had got into bed. \\n\\nI told him this makes me feel neglected, I come up to spend time with him and go to bed early just for him and he wasn't even coming to bed or acknowledging my efforts. (I would cut activities short to go up to bed early for him. Even if I had work to do I would push it to the next day because previously he expressed getting a good night's sleep was important to him.) \\nThis continues for a few weeks of me telling him it was hurting my feelings and him doing his own thing. \\n\\nEventually I decide enough is enough and tell him to come down and spend time with me if that's what he wants. I'm not going to wait upstairs being ignored when I could be doing something I enjoy. \\nI carry this on for a month. I will admit he told me he wished I would go back to being in bed earlier but I told him that I had put effort it and got nothing in return so now it was his turn. I made sure I was going to bed the same time as him so I wouldn't disturb him but I wouldn't go up early to wait anymore. This continues for a week and yes I did feel like we weren't spending enough time together but I was tired of wasting my time for someone who really didn't seem to care. \\n\\nToday he says that he feels like I don't give him any love anymore because we don't talk or cuddle before bed like we used to. I explained to him why I stopped coming in early and reminded him that I had said if he wants to spend time with me he just needed to say and I would have come to spend time with him. He said he would have tried if I started coming to bed earlier but I didn't so he felt like I didn't care and that it's my fault we haven't been spending time together.\\n\\nI feel like he's ignoring what I'm saying and trying to blame it on me because he was too lazy to make the effort.

My mother found out about it and confided in my GrandMother (my father\\'s mother/mom\\'s MIL) who told her \"Oh grow up, everyone has affairs.\" A little while later,  after his mother encouraged him to do so, my father announced he wanted a divorce.\\n\\nStill, my mother wanted to continue having a relationship with my GM. She asked her at one point \"Do you still love me even though your son divorced me?\" and my GM said \"Well, I love you as best I can.\"\\n\\nFast forward to now. I have been no contact with my father for two years, for reasons totally unrelated to all the previously mentioned drama. Last year, I got engaged and asked my GM if she would still come to the wedding even if I didn\\'t invite my dad, and she said \"yes, of course.\" My fiancé and I decided on our date and after much painful consideration and flip-flopping back and forth, I finally decided I definitely did not want my father at our wedding. I informed my father of this and he responded in a generally positive tone, saying he understood where I was coming from and hoped we could work on things in the future.\\n\\nThen, my GM sent me a long email about how upsetting it was for *her* to hear that I had not invited my dad, that *she* would find it heart-wrenching to attend a wedding where the bride\\'s father was not present, and so, in protest of my decision, she was declining to attend the wedding. I was pretty shocked by this and still feel very hurt. She sent me this email on Valentine\\'s Day and has not said a word to me since, until...\\n\\nLast week, my fiancé and I had to put down our dog. I texted my GM to ask if we could scatter his ashes at her lake house, since our dog loved roaming the woods around that house. She informed me that her other son (my uncle) and her brother/his wife (my great-uncle and great-aunt) were coming to town for two weeks but that I could bring the ashes down after they were gone. This felt like she was treating me like a pariah and excluding me from spending time with my own family -- all because I set my own boundaries when it came to the guests at my own wedding.\\n\\nNow, the present issue is that my mother, despite all of this, still continues to seek a relationship with my GM. I haven\\'t said anything about it to my mom, but every time I hear that my mom is going to an event with my GM, or going to an event in support of my GM, I feel hurt and do not feel supported at all. On the one hand, it doesn\\'t feel right to take sides here - so I\\'m not sure exactly what I want my mom to do, all I know is that the entire situation makes me feel abandoned by my own family. The longer it goes on, the more resentful I feel about it and it feels like I should say something, but I don\\'t want to be the asshole telling my mom she needs to pick a side, since that\\'s exactly what my GM has done.\\n\\nAITA here?', 'send_replies': False, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 617537, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'top', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for feeling resentful that my mother continues to have a relationship with my grandmother (her MIL) after many years of poor treatment?', 'updated_utc': 1554489008, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b81mzo/aita_for_feeling_resentful_that_my_mother/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

This was always temporary. \\n\\nI went home for the holidays and when I came back in February I noticed people fighting and shouting and crying. This building is so damn old you can hear ever thing. At first I thought the guy was beating his wife cuz he yells and shouts at 3-4 am when I assume he comes home drunk from the bar and she cries. I brought this to the attention of my uncle who is friends with my landlord and he also knows my dad. \\n\\nMy uncle basically said there is nothing I can do about it. Okay so I try and put up with it. But Wednesday through Friday I have class at 8 am and I can't keep waking up that early from these people yelling. A few days ago I had enough it was Wednesday morning at 5 am and I knocked on the door asking if everything was okay. He told me that his mother is in pain (don't know why he's yelling) I offered to call an ambulance or get her some pain killers anything to shut her up. I have class in the morning. After that encounter I heard nothing from them until Saturday morning. This time they did this ordeal at 8am. One of 2 days I can sleep in I'm up at 8. \\n\\nI don't say anything I told my uncle about me going to the door he said if it happens again we will call the police. I know this country police won't do shit. But I went and found a new place to live . And told my uncle I'm moving as I can't do this anymore. He tells me that what I'm doing is a dick move because I'm not giving his friend enough notice. I also told him I will pay for this month's rent no problems (it's only 200 euro).\\n\\nFastforward to today. I had to be up at 8am again. 3am it starts... At 5am it gets even worse I recorded it and sent it to some people and the responded asking me if I live at a farm because that doesn't sound human. I called the police and as soon as I said the street name they literally filled in the rest saying they had 3 other complaints. I think the police came around 7am but around 830 am I heard her yelling again. \\n\\nI offered to show my uncle and land Lord this recording and he's like I don't care it's still not okay what you did. I am moving out today I will end up paying 850 euros to move into this new place since I used an agency. And 200 euros for this months rent to give this man a month to find someone new.

Last night I finally felt ok enough to have sex and pushed through my mental issues and feelings of insecurity. I thought it would be a nice surprise.\\n\\nWe have sex. He comes in less than 5 minutes, then says \"I feel shitty for coming so quickly,\" disposes of the condom, and turns in for the night. Without saying anything else.\\n\\nAfter 10 minutes or so I said, \"We\\'re just not going to talk? You\\'re going to sleep?\" And I expressed that hey y\\'know I\\'d like to get off too... then he said \"oh sorry I didn\\'t even think of that.\"\\n\\nThrough all of this I was patient and understanding. I wasn\\'t mad that he came too quickly. What upset me is that the thought didn\\'t even enter his head that maybe I\\'d enjoy an orgasm as well. And then after I made this known, he just thinks \"🤷\\u200d♂️ srry\" is an appropriate response.\\n\\nI tried to explain my feelings to him and then he cut me off and started telling me what I was feeling, then shifted the focus back to him. He has a habit of talking over me and cutting me off when I\\'m speaking, which discourages me from talking. He has ADHD (untreated) so I\\'ve been understanding about this, but I\\'m a person with feelings too.\\n\\nI told him it\\'s ok that he came so quickly, there\\'s other stuff he could do (i.e. oral, hand stuff), but he didn\\'t do anything like that. He eventually just left my apartment rather than make any effort to understand my feelings. Later he texted me and it came out that he wasn\\'t in the mood. Which doesn\\'t make sense to me, because he came on to me daily for about a week. He came on to me last night even! Why would you do that if you weren\\'t in the mood?\\n\\nAfter he left I just used my vibrator for 30 minutes. I would have been completely fine not having sex and getting myself off when he isn\\'t around, except for that he made it very clear to me that he wanted sex\\n\\nAnd for a little context, the last time we had sex before this, he came in less than 5 minutes and didn\\'t try to get me off. I took that in stride, but I don\\'t want this to be the norm--him coming in less than 5 minutes and me being sexually frustrated.\\n\\nAlso, this relationship is still fairly new. We\\'ve been seeing each other one month. I know there is a learning curve at this stage in the game but his behavior just seems really self centered, and I don\\'t know of it\\'s worth it to commit to someone who doesn\\'t make an effort to understand my feelings\\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nBf tries to initiate sex daily for a week, we finally have sex, he comes in less than 5 minutes, makes no effort to understand my feelings or get me off, leaves my apartment \\n\\nAm I the asshole?', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 617654, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'top', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for getting upset after disappointing sex with the bf?', 'updated_utc': 1554489363, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b8267k/aita_for_getting_upset_after_disappointing_sex/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

We have been dating for 3 years and have a pretty solid relationship. We both have some personal issues we have been working on but have been getting better. \\n\\nAfter I graduated college in 2015 my friends and I have been makokg a yearly trip to Texas to get together and have fun (one of our friends lives there now). I also have a lot of family in Texas and visit them/stay with them too. Growing up I didnt have much and didnt travel so it\\'s very important to me. I\\'ve done this every spring since 2016 and it is the only time I get to spend with my friends since we all live in different parts of the country (they\\'re still my best/closest friends despite me having some friends where I live). I also cherish time with my family (my cousin and husband and their kids, my aunts).\\n\\nThe first year of me and my gf dating (2017), her family had already planned a trip to NH and me to Texas. It was only q week and we had no real problems there. The second year (last year) I had talked to her about her coming with me for one week to stay with family and then the second week I would stay with just friends. She did not like this and thought i wasn\\'t considering her when making plans to go. \\n\\nAfter a lot of consideration and talking through it, she was mostly right. I wasn\\'t actively avoiding having her come but I wasn\\'t trying as hard as I should to include her on my trip and consider her thoughts and feelings. We talked it out and I apologized. I recognize that I should have involved her earlier in the process and asked what she thought about the trip before taking the time off of work and planning with my friends/family.\\n\\nBecause it was too late and she couldn\\'t get the time off, and since I already had booked the flights/time off and my friends and family were expecting me, I ended up going on the two week trip myself. Usually it is only one so this was a lot of time. I still had fun but i realized how I had been wrong and wanted to include my girlfriend on my next trip to Texas. \\n\\nThis year in January I brought up doing the trip. I made it a point to ask her what she thought, what she wanted, her thoughts on flying - she doesnt care to travel much and gets anxious about meeting new people/my family so she seemed reserved. I told her that my idea was to go for a week and spend the first half of the vacation with her and my family, and for her to meet my friends and spend a day with us - but that the second half of vacation I just wanted to spend with my friends. She did NOT like this because she thought I was \"abandoning her\" and \"making her fly home alone\". She said that I clearly hadn\\'t learned from last year and that I was being selfish. \\n\\nI gave it some thought and I think she is partially right - I am being selfish in wanting to spend 2-3 days with just my friends and not considering how she hasnt flown in a long time and that is  scary for her. \\n\\nWhat I am hung up on is that I never get to see these friends (my closest friends) and this is the only time I get to hang out with them and do stuff that we like to do, which she frankly doesn\\'t like to do (e.g. go to breweries, go hiking, play video games). I want to work something out with her where I can spend this time with my friends but she doesnt feel like I am abandoning her or making her feel left out. She has all of her friends living within a 15 minute drive of where we live in Massachusetts because we moved to her home town, but all my friends live in different states and I dont get the same option she has to spend quality \"just friends\" time with just them. I have tried to ask her how we can handle this but she is very absolute in that IF I do any part of the trip just by myself that I am wrong. \\n\\nAITA for wanting to spend alone time with my friends?', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 617672, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'Am I The Asshole for wanting to spend some time alone on vacation with my friends?', 'updated_utc': 1554489713, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b829s2/am_i_the_asshole_for_wanting_to_spend_some_time/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

I\\'m not the one to seek out communication with them in any way, but most of us are that way. That is, aside from my grandmother. She\\'s always been kind of the matriarch of our family - all finances and financial decisions have been her, and this has given her a feeling of incredible self importance, at least that\\'s what I think. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nRecently I moved back to my home town after living in the big city for a number of years, and my current residence is neighbouring my grandmother\\'s house. This meant that she expected I go visit her every single day, staying there talking and doing her housework for hours a day, didn\\'t matter if I had work that day. That\\'s because my brother, when he lived home, and my father, when he still was alive, were doing exactly that - going there sitting for hours and letting themselves to be basically bullied. I have a reason to believe this was a contributing factor to my father\\'s suicide three years ago, and grandmother is still saying, how he could leave her. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhat I\\'m trying to say is that she\\'s an incredibly harsh person to be around. I\\'ll give you a few examples:\\n\\n* at my father\\'s funeral she snapped at me how I haven\\'t done anything with my life and basically am nothing. She had to be shushed by a distant relative;\\n* she talks about my siblings and me behind our backs. My sister\\'s fiance once caught her in a phone conversation telling the other person how they shouldn\\'t trust sister\\'s fiance and how he\\'s a \"sketchy person\". She tried to deny all of the conversation on the spot, and still expects him to do what she wants despite them living in another country;\\n* she thinks that I should spend time with her because she has given me money for things like rent and food in the past while I was living in the big city.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, I don\\'t respond to her phone calls anymore. Today I found a letter in my mail box, not paid and barely addressed (which means she told about this situation to the postman.

For those that don\\'t know, SW boards in groups only and you don\\'t have assigned seating. You are simply assigned a group and then a number. Groups are A, B, and C and the numbers go from 1-65 (or so). If you are given A 25 you are typically the 25 person aboard the plane, give or take (but the exact numbers aren\\'t important here).\\n\\nOur meal was a little late prior to boarding so I went ahead and decided to board ahead of my family. As we have done countless times before, I\\'d just hold a couple seats for them as I know they were right behind me. I had boarding letter/number A45. Southwest flies nothing but 737s with three variations. You either have 143 or 175 seats available. \\n\\nI sat down in an aisle seat and threw my jacket over the middle and window arm rest. Two minutes later a young woman stopped at my seat, looked at me and said \"I want to sit there.\" pointing at the window seat. I politely said \"Oh, sorry, I\\'m trying to save these for my son and wife who are not far behind you. Her reply - \"So?\" I said \"But, 60% of the plane is still empty.

Given the characteristics of the players involved, me uttering a single word would have lead to an international incident - that I am sure of. \\n\\nAITA for moving here? Should I have stood my ground? I get it - open seating. But the plan was, again literally, less than half full at this point. I have been flying for business for over 25 years. I\\'m quite sure that I have flown more than 85% or more of the general population.

I’m not a native speaker, so sorry for eventual mistakes. Also I’m writing this on my phone.\\n\\nA little background - me and my boyfriend have been together for a little over a year now. When we started dating, he was working very irrlegularly, worked for one company for a month, got fired, worked at a different place for two weeks and quit, and after that he stopped working or even looking for a job for whole two months of summer, while I was spending 10/11 hours at work each day, no free days (I’m a horse riding instructor, and summer is a very busy time in my field). He worked a month in september, just before we left to work abroad. We came back at the end of january, and most of the money we earned went into our car and renting a new place, since we want to move to a different city in February, and we did. He found a good job in his field(he’s an electrician) almost right away, while I had some trouble, since I can’t really work as a horseriding instructor at the moment due to my arms injury, and I don’t have a lot of experience or education otherwise. Since my boyfriends work was well paid of, he told me to take my time and find a job that I would like. Unfortunately, in middle of march he was let go, and our situation became pretty bad, as we didn’t really have any money then and hoped for April to be better thanks to his salary. When that happened, I immediately took the first job offer I’ve got, and he found a job at a local restaurant few days ago, so we will manage, but money will be pretty tight still.\\nSome time ago, my boyfriend mentioned wanting to go to a concert of a band he liked along with his friends. I supported the idea, thinking that we’ll be on a better footing when the time came. Well, the time came and we’re currently living on money borrowed from my parents, and today he tells me he’s going to buy a ticket. I pointed out to him that the ticket for a concert, along with train tickets will take a good quarter of what we will receive this month, and told him not to whine at the end of the month that we have no money(he tends to get very angry about it). He told me to fuck off, and that we would have no money not because of his spending, but as an effect of me not going to work two weeks earlier so I could make a full month.\\nI’m feeling pretty hurt as I have never had any pretences to him while he wasn’t working and I was basically sponsoring him, but I also know that our situation was different back then, as we only paid half of what we’re paying now for our flat, so I also feel very guilty for not going to work sooner, especially since I would end up with an equally shitty job as I did now.

Older men on tablets with earbuds in, so it\\'s fairly quiet and usually I can get a lot done.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nToday though as I was waiting for my drink a grizzled guy started talking to me, asking my name, if I was going to work.

You must like money.\" Then he started telling me all about him and how he lost his wallet and ebt card, etc. etc. It was embarrassing, because I just didn\\'t want to be put on the spot like that in front of everyone, but I felt like I had to talk to him to be polite.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSomething was just off in him.

Repeating \"I\\'m a bad man, I\\'m a bad man\" to himself loudly. Then someone else came in who he started peppering with questions. Finally they just turned around and walked away.

I covered my ears with my hands to drown him out.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFinally some policemen came in and he made a hasty exit- they were just there to get their coffee- no one had called them.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt was a big relief that he had left, but I still couldn\\'t concentrate on what I needed to be doing, so I left too. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBut I felt really bad.

She loves every apsect of her job, except her boss, \"Josh,\" who seemed a little too into her. Always complenting her outfits and with the lingering stares. She said it made her a bit uncomfortable, but he never did anything overt, so she assumed it was just a crush.\\n\\n\\nBut this pissed me off. Some random guy crushing on my wife, working with her every day, barely toeing the line of impropriety. So yesterday, I went to her office, but I visisted Josh and confronted him about his feelings towards my wife. He admitted it, but he seemed regretful and said that he could probably get her transferred to a different department (same pay, but with better hours), as he\\'s obviously made us uncomfortable, and he regrets it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this point I was seething on the inside. I didn\\'t want this guy in the same building as wife. I didn\\'t care if it was different departments. So I knew he had to go. I told him that my wife and I had an open relationship, and that she actually reciprocated his attraction towards her. I then said that I was telling him this because she was very shy, and would never make a move. However, I said that she was definitely into him, and that if he tried something it would make her so happy and she\\'d probably fall into his arms. \\n\\n\\n\\nNow the thing is, we don\\'t have an open relationship, and she isn\\'t into him. At all. But like an idiot, Josh fell for it hook, line, and sinker. He profusely thanked me and promised to be respectful. I could barely contain my laughter until I was in the elevator. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSure enough, THAT DAY, Josh calls my wife into his office and makes a move. He confessed his feelings and tried to kiss her, which of course caused her to freak out. Long story short, Josh was fired effective immediately, and my wife is getting a new boss. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy wife came home shaken up, so I laughed and told her how I engineered this whole thing. I expected her to be grateful to me for getting rid of her creepy boss. But instead she freaked out at me, saying that I \"betrayed her trust,\" and set her up to be assualted. I told her that she was overreacting, which just caused her to get angrier. She threw together an overnight bag and said she was going to her sister\\'s for a few days, maybe longer.\\n\\n\\nNow, the way I see it, I caused her momentary discomfort, but I made her work life 100 times better. However, she\\'s so short-sighted that she can\\'t see I did this all for her. I\\'m actually pretty angry at her for running away from me instead of talking to me like an adult.

I understand this is selfish but I had made it clear from the get-go this was what I wanted.\\n\\n\\nIn the end she ‘gave in’ and said I can take it but did say various comments about me being stubborn and never compromising.

When I first meet D I had just gotten out of a serious relationship 2 weeks before. When I met D everything is great but an issue that bothered me was that she was seeing my roomate at the time, she didnt know,when she found out she asked him if it was ok. She then started seeing me. I did tell her I broke up with my girlfriend over a month ago because the first time we met she mentioned that she doesnt get involved with people who just broke up with thier SOs.\\n\\nWe only spent breaks together but she was home for 2 months due to and internship and getting time off school. So we saw eachother alot. When she was gone we texted and I said I missed you a couple times. We definantly texted alot and I called her when things where going bad for her at college. Everytime she was gone we would text everyday, tell eachother I miss you and talked about how excited we where to see eachother. I knew she was seeing other people, she even texted them when we hung out She apparently had an std scare when a partners condom broke, and she called me right away. One time I knew she had sex with another person that day and came over 8 hours later.\\n\\nA couple weeks ago D suddenly texted me asking were we where going and that we have been kinda acting like more then fwbs? D then told me that if I wasnt going to date her eventually then she didnt want to be involved much longer. I told D that my depression was bad so I cant really make that decision. I thanked her for coming over and helping me multiple times and picking me up from work. She then told me that she\\'ll keep seeing me but if Im not going to commit then she is going to keep seeing other people. D tells me to tell her if im not interested anymore or are seeing other people.\\n\\nD\\'s spring break comes along and we text how excited we are to meet again, but after the first day. I dont want to see her. My anxiety acts up so I just stop opening her snaps. D contacts me on facebook saying \"Why are you ghosting me? Youre active on snapchat but not opening my messages? I thought you wanted to see me over break?\" So I tell her I never wanted to be with her and that Im too depressed to think about being in a relationship and that her pushing made me uncomfortable. Then I blocked her. She saw my post with my new girlfriend 4 days after we talked. She sent me messages calling me a liar, and saying I never respected her. I told her that she was gross for sleeping with someone else the same day she came to see me and that she cant be mad I dont have feelings for her. She responded by calling me a coward that lead her on and slut shamed her. She also told me if I didnt have feelings for her then I shouldnt tell her I missed her or was excited to see her and shouldve told her no when she asked what we wanted for the future.\\n\\nTd:lr: Fwb mad because of how I rejected her.', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 617907, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'top', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for how I split up with my FWB?', 'updated_utc': 1554490376, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b82ybn/aita_for_how_i_split_up_with_my_fwb/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

She doesnt have enough money to travel but it's enough to live on. \\n\\nNow that shes been gone a year I have found myself not wanting to put in much of an effort. She says she loves it there and doesn't want to move back. It honestly feels like I'm hurting myself for no payoff.

I never ask for it but she genuinely enjoys helping me. I even told her my mom offered to help but she kept insisting so I obliged. We went over it and she made a good amount of corrections which mostly consisted of grammatical errors and some word order changes.

The entire time she was helping I kept telling her thank you and how I am going to shower her with love when she comes down to see me this thursday (we do college long distance). When we were finishing up she asked how long it had to be so I told her 10 pages but what I had was fine. She started telling me how I had to write more but to be honest I had no idea what else to write and my brain was fried. I had been there now for 11 straight hours so I was exhausted and ready to go home. She ended up freaking out calling me lazy and ungrateful because I did not appreciate her and that she could have been out smoking with her friends instead of helping me. I kept tell her how I was grateful and appreciated everything she had just done and that I love her. That wasn't enough though and she kept saying how she felt used all because I didn't want to write anymore. She also said she spent 2.5 hours helping which is just not true because the time log said she was in the document for an hour and 20 minutes. When I got home to facetime her she was down the entire time and not really saying much. When we went to bed she hit me with a long text again how she felt unappreciated and I didn't seem to care even though I kept telling her repeatedly thank you and I love you. Am I the asshole here?

For those unfamiliar, this is when you only utilized shampoo/conditioner every few months. You still wet and hand scrub in the shower every few days. The idea is that you\\'re allowing the scalp to self-regulate and find a balance with the amount of natural oils present on the head. His hair isn\\'t gross, per-say. It just looks, feels, and smells a little greasy. It\\'s not the sleasy-looking type of greasy; it just looks like he uses a lot of gel. He got the idea from a mutual friend who doesn\\'t wash her hair often because she is constantly traveling. Her hair is INCREDIBLE and she can easily style it because the natural oil allows her hair to hold shape.\\n\\nSo my question is WIBTA if I requested he wash his hair for a little while to see how it looks. As I seriously value body autonomy and person choice, I would feel selfish asking him to do so. I\\'m conflicted. In the years we\\'ve been dating, hes washed it maybe a 12-20 times.

His person hygiene is great in general. These shampoo-ings, however, are not the deep conditioning that would be needed to remove the oils, however. So it feels softer but it\\'s still not 100% clean.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure if I am considering this purely out of curiosity or if there is a part of me that secretly thinks his hair is disgusting. Occasionally during sexy times he\\'ll want me to grab his hair but I\\'m hesitant to because it\\'s greasy. I don\\'t think that\\'s the reasoning but the unconscious mind is a complex thing.\\n\\nAlso, I always welcome personal experiences and information about no \\'poo! And if INFO is needed, let me know. I know this is a bit of a ramble. \\n\\nIn judging this, please try to judge based on whether this would be an acceptable request given his right to bodily autonomy, not whether you think not washing your hair is a gross thing. As his girlfriend, am I allowed to make sure a request?

Yesterday was my girlfriend\\'s birthday, and the past couple of days have been pretty bad to put it lightly. The day prior I took her out to eat, took her shopping, and then took her to her favorite little park that has a waterfall. I was trying my best to keep it together, but pain like this is going to show no matter what. I apparently frustrated her because I complained quite a few times about how much pain I was in and with the pace I had to walk (part of the pain right now is in my leg and I have to limp around so I walk pretty slowly). That night I went to bed pretty early as my disease causes me fatigue (and we did quite a bit that day) and that is the only way for me to escape the pain besides drowning myself in painkillers and the like.\\n\\nThe morning of her birthday I slept in again for the same reason, and I know this upset her very much. I didn\\'t wake up until around noon, which meant half of her birthday was already over :(. When I woke up I gave her her gifts (everything she told me she wanted: a new ring, shoes, some makeup and a bouquet of flowers). After that, it took me quite a while to get ready and we didn\\'t end up leaving the apartment until around 2:30 to head to her family\\'s house (when she originally told me she wanted to leave around noon). At her family\\'s house I didn\\'t really talk much and didn\\'t participate in all of the things they were doing because of my pain. \\n\\nAfter all of this we had to head to her grandmother\\'s house as she was leaving for a trip and she wanted us to take care of her dog and watch over the house. While packing my stuff I admittedly snapped on her a little bit as I felt like I was reaching my limit and was having to carry around a couple of pretty heavy things which increased my pain even more. \\n\\nThis morning she told me that I \"ruined\" her 21st birthday and she feels like I don\\'t care about her. She texted me \"one day...my fucking birthday...that\\'s all I wanted.\"\\n\\nNow in addition to the pain I feel fucking awful. It hurt so bad to hear that I \"ruined\" her 21st birthday and I kind of fell silent after that because I didn\\'t know what to say which just made her more upset with me.\\n\\nSomeone please give me their opinion on what is going on here.

After a bit of a scene this Valentine’s day, I resolved to stop drinking completely. I relapsed once, a few days after February 14th, and my wife was very upset. I saw how much it broke her, so I stopped completely that day. I haven’t touched it since.\\n\\nWe’ve been doing okay. My wife has withdrew affection completely earlier, but we’ve been gradually increasing intimacy, going back out on dates, etc. I really did thought that our marriage was recovering after all I’ve done.\\n\\nAnyways, last week my wife put the trash down the street for the garbage man. This is INSANELY unusual; my wife has (diagnosed) OCD and touching the trash outright repulses her. Well when I saw it, I knew something was up, and so I went to investigate. There wasn’t much trash in there, but there WAS a trashbag that had almost nothing in it. I looked inside and it was…. 3 pregnancy tests. All positive. I was elated. I figured my wife had a good reason to not tell me so I waited.  \\n\\nCome Sunday, she’s given me no hint, so I asked her if she had any news. She said nope. I asked her about the pregnancy tests. She looked like a deer in headlights and asked how I knew. I told her it doesn’t matter and we can finally be a family and she bursts into tears. \\n\\nLong-story short Reddit: she had an abortion. Now, regardless of how you guys feel about abortion, I’m FIRMLY pro-life. It’s just how I feel; unless the mom’s life is in danger, you made your choices. Lie with them. And my wife knew, which is why she didn’t tell me. She cried and pleaded with me to hear her out. That our marriage wasn’t on great ground and she wanted to wait until we were more stable to have children. That she wanted to make sure my drinking problem has been completely gone.\\n\\nI’m just so upset. My wife knows my pro-life views (hell SHE said herself she was pro-life). I just can’t believe she would do this to me. We’ve been trying for such a long time. And she killed him. She didn’t even TELL me. She was never going to tell me. I’m just so hurt.\\n\\nI’ve pretty much blocked my wife on my phone or with any method of communication. My phone was being blown up by my friends, her friends, my parents, her parents, everyone, so I just let its battery die. Right now I’m in a hotel room typing this on my laptop. I’m not ready to talk. My marriage is over. I’m filing for divorce this week.  Everyone in my life is getting her biased perspective of the story and is telling me I’m overreacting and I truly can’t see if I’m thinking straight. \\n\\nSo tell me Reddit, AITA for being so mad at my wife for killing my child?\\n\\nTLDR; wife aborted wanted child.

She gets the images from the photostream that my brother set up. I asked my mother to never share a picture of my daughter on her social media accounts. Aside from my desire for privacy, her FB account has been hacked multiple times and she has questionable friends- some are clearly robots.\\n\\nShe gave me flack for this request, saying it was not a big deal, I am being over reactive, etc. I held my ground and she relented.\\nI rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom’s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it’s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don’t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.\\n\\nI was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.\\n\\nSo, I kicked her off the photostream. It’s been two weeks, and we haven’t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she’s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).\\nI have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer.

She\\'s a sweet and loving person, also really shy. When we began dating I introduced her to two of my closer friends (who are siblings) but for some reason they didn\\'t seem to want to talk with her very much and preferred to talk to our other mutual friend present. By virtue of being shy she found it hard to start conversation, and my attempts at trying to initiate conversation between them was in vain. Later they told me that my SO seemed distant and \"unfriendly\" even when I told to them that its hard for her to meet new people.\\n\\nThey kept this coldness towards her and I have no idea why, but then a week later I was invited to hang out with them at a park and they let me bring Nicole. They specified that we should meet at 9AM, it opens at 9:30AM. I pick up Nicole and we get to the park on time.They weren\\'t there, and half an hour later they still hadn\\'t texted or shown up so we went to a nearby starbucks. Come 11AM I still hadn\\'t heard from them after many texts and a couple calls to their phones, and we had been in starbucks for nearly two hours. I tried calling again, then Nicole and I started going home.  I assumed something important came up, so I wasn\\'t mad. I was a little annoyed, but if something happened to where they couldn\\'t text or call me then it must\\'ve been an emergency. \\n\\nOn my way home I got a text saying they were on their way. I called and said we had been waiting for hours with no response from either of them so we had left. This completely set them off. One of them started accusing me of leaving so I could go \"fuck my girlfriend\" and I was ditching them \"for that slutty bitch.\" Keep in mind, they never took the chance to even get to know anything about Nicole yet they were saying this. I told them it was unfair that we showed up at the time agreed on, and we were out for nearly three hours waiting on them without any response from them. They said I shouldn\\'t have left without telling them but then I pointed out all the times I tried getting in touch. This kept going until I started ignoring their texts since half of it was just insulting Nicole. I showed her the texts and we just wondered why they pinned it on her when it was I that drove there and I made the decision to go home.\\n\\nEver since, they\\'ve been cold towards her. I\\'ve brought up how shitty they are to my SO and they shrug it off, saying that they don\\'t have any obligation to like a person.

However, I\\'ve been pondering this situation for around 4 years now and wonder if I was the asshole. Preamble aside, lets lay out the situation.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI was 18 and working at HEB when I found my first (and currently only) GF. She was another employee that I met in the break-room, and she caught my attention due to being interested in many of the things that I was interested, such as games, science, and fantasy. While I didn\\'t find her attractive due to her weight (I\\'m from a skinny family, and did not find overweight attractive), I wanted to and date her for who she was. This was the problem that came to rear its ugly head.\\n\\nThe relationship went well for a couple of months, until we tried to escalate into a sexual relationship. While I found her pretty, and cute even, I did not find her sexy. This became very apparent on a physical level, as I was unable to maintain an erection due to her figure. This led to a lot of hard feelings between us, both feeling incompetent for the other.\\n\\nI did offer to work with her; I invited her to my workouts, I offered to diet with her, etc. However, she laid the blame on me, trying to get me to change my perspective on sexuality/what I found attractive. This weathered away at our relationship for a few months before it ended, leaving us both feeling uneasy/angry. I will admit, I did try only a little to change my perspective on the matter, and unsuccessfully at that.\\n\\nAnd for the meat of it. On the last day, in my home (we did live apart), she laid out an ultimatum that I need to be finding her attractive within 2 months, or she was leaving me. I confronted her angrily about it, saying I can\\'t change it, and told her to leave. She refused, and I wound up bodily bringing her to the door and locking her out of the house, as I told myself I was unwilling to live with ultimatums that I saw as avoidable/impossible/non-negotiable. Even though she knocked for a time, and offered to go back on her statement, I refused to go and let her in anymore.\\n\\n   For the final prompt. AITA for:\\n\\n1) Entering a relationship knowing I did not find the other attractive \\n\\n2) Not attempting therapy for myself to change my sexual perspective/desires\\n\\n3) Taking a final stance and enforcing it physically\\n\\n4) Refusing to allow her to withdraw the ultimatum and working it out\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSorry again if this falls under the \"stop posting general relationship stuff\" category.

I absolutely love my work as a choir director for these kids, and I really do enjoy hearing them sing. \\n\\nI am in the beginning stages of planning my wedding, and a question came up concerning the music during the ceremony. I had the idea to ask my little cherub choir to sing, and my fiancee loved the idea, as she knows how dear those kids' voices are to me, and how much they would enjoy being there for the ceremony, if only as the musicians. \\n\\nI mentioned this idea to the kids at our last rehearsal, and they were all very excited. A few mentioned to me that it made them feel like 'real musicians', to do a wedding gig. I pitched this idea to the parents of the choir, and the majority seem pretty okay with it. However, a few felt jilted, when I explained that the parents and children would not be guests at the ceremony, nor at the reception. The ceremony will only be attended by our immediate family at whatever venue we choose, and the parents would be able to either drop off their kids for the duration of the ceremony, or wait it out in seating in another area. The reception will take place hours later, likely in my own backyard, and there will not be anyone invited that is under the age of 21, for a variety of reasons, the least of which is the presence of alcohol. \\n\\nThe kids are old enough and experienced enough to behave themselves for the duration of the ceremony, and most of the parents (including those few that are complaining) do not attend most of the church services nor other events the kids sing at, so I don't see how this is any different. And again, most of the parents seem fine with it. \\n\\nI told the parents who were frustrated that if they didn't like not being guests, then their kids wouldn't have to sing, and they could just skip the event- 10/12 singers would work just as well. That, for some reason, angered them more.\\n\\nAITA for wanting my students to sing at my wedding? AITA for not inviting their parents to attend the intimate ceremony?

My wife and I recently went on a short trip to catch a sporting event in a rival city. We had a good time, had 5 nice meals, and stayed at a reasonably priced hotel for two nights. \\n\\nWe’re a single-income household with me being the breadwinner and we don’t travel often to save money. This trip was in the works for half a year and I worked the budget (hotel, restaurants, gas, ect) to where I didn’t feel too guilty taking this vacation. \\n\\nMy wife mentioned she wanted to stop by somewhere to get a souvenir for the trip. No problem, we were over-budget but something small would be fine. She had me drive to a popular local-brand store and wanted to buy a $115 hooded sweatshirt. I basically vetoed the purchase saying it was too expensive. I asked her if she could find something she wanted for closer to $50 (still about $25 more than I was thinking) but she wasn’t a fan of the lower-priced items and complained they didn’t have anything she liked in medium other than the $115 shirt. \\n\\nIt didn't seem to bother her too much, but on the drive home (3 hours) she was very quiet with the occasional comment about how she was still thinking about the hoodie. I felt super guilty about spending money on this vacation and telling my wife she couldn't have the one thing she asked for. At the same time, I just felt $115 was way too much money to spend on a sweatshirt with a popular brand name.\\n\\nFor perspective, I spent about $400 total on hotel, game tickets, meals and other expenses. We’re only about to save $150 a month or so with bills and such.

I didn't call either of them, and it stems from an incident that happened last July involving my girlfriend.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSome context:\\n\\nMy sister and I have a very combative relationship. She's in her 40s and has never had success in her career. It's not entirely her fault, but she takes it out on other people. I'm younger and things have gone better for me, but she thinks that I can help her in ways that I can't. Years ago I hired a woman (my intern) into a full-time job. My sister was **furious** over this and said I should have given her the job. My sister wasn't qualified for it, my intern had a relevant Masters degree, and my sister lived 3000 miles away. Years after that, I left that job and began dating my former co-worker. We're still dating.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n(My sister and I have talked about that job, and once she seemed to understand and accept that it was the right decision.)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nLast July my sis &amp; nephew came to visit. My nephew is among my favorite people in the world and we play all kinds of games every time we're together. The first few days went OK. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOne afternoon we were on a pier dancing to a jazz band and having a good time. My GF joined us, and as soon as she showed up my sister shut down. She didn't say hi to her, didn't acknowledge her presence, just looked straight through her. We walked 10 minutes to a restaurant and she wouldn't say a thing to her the whole time. In the restaurant my GF was seated immediately across from her. My sister still wouldn't acknowledge her. My GF felt so awkward and insulted that she made up an excuse and left. (My GF &amp; my sis have met a few times before w/o incident.)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI was livid. After my nephew went to bed I told my sister how angry I was. She said I that I had no empathy for her and said that my GF would never get an apology. She left town a couple days later (earlier than planned) and we haven't spoken since. That was 9 months ago.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis past week included the bdays of my sis and nephew. I sent him a note and a gift and I included a short letter to my sister saying that I wanted her to be a part of my life, and that I hoped we could treat the people in both of our lives with respect. I didn't call my nephew though, bc I didn't want to go through my sister. This is the first time I haven't spoken to him on his bday. My sister never responded to the letter, and that was 2 weeks ago. (I sent the gift early.)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe day after my nephew's bday I learned (from my dad) that my sister needed $150 to take her dog to the vet. I sent my dad $300 and told him to give it to my sis. He suggested I include a card, but I've already written her a letter to which she hadn't responded, so I'm not sending a card.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow it's been 5 days. I haven't heard from my sister. I'd like to speak to her and to my nephew. And I'd like her to apologize to my GF.

My girlfriend is currently saddled with over $15,000 in *her mother\\'s debt* that was put in credit cards/student loans under my girlfriend\\'s name, and she is intent to get a second job just to help pay off debt that isn\\'t hers.\\n\\nApparently, my girlfriend started borrowing her mother money at 16 as things at the household were tight, but under the table payments in cash, which certainly isn\\'t counted in that first total, eventually turned into credit cards after her mom maxed out her own and tanked her credit score.\\n\\nMy future MIL has consistently said that she would pay these back, and took out loans that she promised would be applied to the debt. However, she instead used these loans to pay for vehicles, a tummy-tuck, and trips. For one of these loans, my girlfriend took a lean out on *her own vehicle* as collateral for the loan.\\n\\nI recently broke when two separate events compounded to give me the impression that this woman will never pay my girlfriend back. The first of these events took place back in December when, as legal guardian of my girlfriend\\'s twin half-siblings, took money from their savings accounts to pay down debt. This money had been given to them by their father to set up college funds and they had no knowledge of the withdrawal. They are 13 years old and certainly do not track those accounts.\\n\\nThe second incident, and the tipping point, occurred last week. My girlfriend pays her family\\'s general expenses for the month and is then repaid when her mom gets her paycheck. She lives at home (for the moment) and thinks this is fine as she has never had much of an issue in being repaid. Her mother has now missed 2 payments and this week came to her asking for an extra $600 to pay the water bill which is apparently overdue by multiple months.\\n\\nShe called asking me what to do and I said to refuse to pay it. She has her own expenses and it is too large of a financial strain to deal with. Her mother and her got in a shouting match that had a lot of, \"You live under my roof!\" from my understanding. The two are now at odds, and I am in the middle of it.\\n\\nWhen I came over to go on a weekend getaway, I told her mother that if my girlfriend paid off a single one of her credit cards, she would never see her grandchildren. She then went on a tirade about how horrible that was, and that I was brainwashing her daughter into hating her family. She has since spread rumors to all of her children and other family members about how terrible and manipulative I have been. My girlfriend is entirely behind me and wants to GTFO of her house to avoid feeling obligated to assist her mother.\\n\\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole here?\\n\\nTLDR; Girlfriend saddled with $15,000 in her mom\\'s debt.

We have certainly had our issues, but this is the first time I\\'m making a post here. This happened Friday and it\\'s still bugging me. Sorry for the lengthy post. Throwaway acct obviously.\\n\\nTL;DR: BF made a potentially threatening comment during an argument.\\xa0\\n\\nI had been out at a happy hour event for work because we had met a sales goal. I get home after having a drink or 2, and I\\'m admittedly a little buzzed, but nothing crazy. So my bf was playing music, so I\\'m dancing and talking; we\\'re laughing and having a good time. Then I go to play a song, and start dancing a bit with my hands still on his desk. He gets mad and snaps at me to stop shaking his desk. I\\'m like \"oops, sorry!\" and we continue\\xa0on with the night.\\xa0\\n\\nAn hour or so passes, and I remember I need to scan a copy of my car payment receipt so I can send it in. I pull it out of my bag and set it on his desk. It was wrinkled so I start trying to flatten it out and he says \"Stop..STOP\" and I guess it took me a second to register that he was telling me to stop. So he snaps at me, I kinda apologize and walk away. Truthfully, I know this apology wasn\\'t very sincere because I thought he was freaking out for no reason. I didn\\'t think I was even shaking his desk this time. So my attitude probably escalated things to start.\\n\\nI go to sit down and he is getting on to me for not listening. I start to defend myself, but stop myself because I realize it\\'s just going to start an argument. But as I am saying \"nevermind\" he points his finger at me and shouts \"DON\\'T!\". I get upset and express that I\\'m not his child and he doesn\\'t get to tell me when I can/can\\'t speak. He starts saying that I didn\\'t have a defense or a point, so he shouldn\\'t have to sit here and listen to it when I\\'m the one in the wrong. I said something like \"you don\\'t get to dictate whether or not I have a point, especially if I haven\\'t even said it yet. AND I was already stopping myself anyways so you jumped the gun and barked an order at me for no reason\"\\xa0\\n\\nWe go back and forth a bit more and he is going on and on about how I wasn\\'t listening and that I need to respect his things (by not shaking his desk). I apologize again and again, while also insisting that he not talk to me like that and that this shouldn\\'t be such a big deal.\\xa0  \\nHe then says something like \"What am I supposed to do when you are shaking my desk and not listening? Take physical action??\" and I was confused and kinda shocked. Then a bit later, he\\'s like \"You\\'re lucky all I did was bark an order at you\" and I start freaking out asking \"What does that even mean, is that supposed to be a threat?\" and that really pissed him off. He took this as a personal insult/stab against him.\\xa0  \\nSide note: I have been in an abusive romantic relationship and was also physically and sexually abused as a child by men. My bf knows this. So I was trying to explain to him that I didn\\'t actually think he\\'d hurt me. That its not a stab towards him, but when men get loud or make statements like that, it brings back memories and I freak out.\\xa0  \\nHe still didn\\'t get it. Scoffed and said something like \"You can probably stop assuming I\\'m going to physically harm you\". I told him that this statement reminded me of \\'thanks i\\'m cured\\' and that it wasn\\'t that easy. When I asked what he meant by his \"You\\'re lucky all I did was bark an order at you\" statement then, he said \"I could have barked 2 orders. I could have barked 3 orders..\"\\xa0  \\nAt the end of it, we agreed that if this happened again, that he should just reassure me that he didn\\'t mean it like that and that he\\'d never hurt me. He seemed annoyed by this, but agreed.\\xa0  \\nHonestly, I\\'m looking for some perspective. I felt like I was the reason for ruining our whole night. I know that because I have had certain experiences, I tend to panic in situations that may not warrant it. Were the statements he made actually threatening, or did I blow this out of proportion? I know I was shaking his desk and had an attitude, but I just feel like I didn\\'t deserve 100% of the guilt. AITA?  \\nI especially want to hear from people who have been with someone who has lived with abuse. Were you offended when your partner got scared or overreacted to something you said/did?

We have certainly had our issues, but this is the first time I\\'m making a post here. This happened Friday and it\\'s still bugging me. Sorry for the lengthy post. Throwaway acct obviously. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI had been out at a happy hour event for work because we had met a sales goal. I get home after having a drink or 2, and I\\'m admittedly a little buzzed, but nothing crazy. So my bf was playing music, so I\\'m dancing and talking; we\\'re laughing and having a good time. Then I go to play a song, and start dancing a bit with my hands still on his desk. He gets mad and snaps at me to stop shaking his desk. I\\'m like \"oops, sorry!\" and we continue\\xa0on with the night.\\xa0\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAn hour or so passes, and I remember I need to scan a copy of my car payment receipt so I can send it in. I pull it out of my bag and set it on his desk. It was wrinkled so I start trying to flatten it out and he says \"Stop..STOP\" and I guess it took me a second to register that he was telling me to stop. So he snaps at me, I kinda apologize and walk away. Truthfully, I know this apology wasn\\'t very sincere because I thought he was freaking out for no reason. I didn\\'t think I was even shaking his desk this time. So my attitude probably escalated things to start.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI go to sit down and he is getting on to me for not listening. I start to defend myself, but stop myself because I realize it\\'s just going to start an argument. But as I am saying \"nevermind\" he points his finger at me and shouts \"DON\\'T!\". I get upset and express that I\\'m not his child and he doesn\\'t get to tell me when I can/can\\'t speak. He starts saying that I didn\\'t have a defense or a point, so he shouldn\\'t have to sit here and listen to it when I\\'m the one in the wrong. I said something like \"you don\\'t get to dictate whether or not I have a point, especially if I haven\\'t even said it yet. AND I was already stopping myself anyways so you jumped the gun and barked an order at me for no reason\"\\xa0\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWe go back and forth a bit more and he is going on and on about how I wasn\\'t listening and that I need to respect his things (by not shaking his desk). I apologize again and again, while also insisting that he not talk to me like that and that this shouldn\\'t be such a big deal.\\xa0\\n\\n  \\nHe then says something like \"What am I supposed to do when you are shaking my desk and not listening? Take physical action??\" and I was confused and kinda shocked. Then a bit later, he\\'s like \"You\\'re lucky all I did was bark an order at you\" and I start freaking out asking \"What does that even mean, is that supposed to be a threat?\" and that really pissed him off. He took this as a personal insult/stab against him.\\xa0\\n\\n  \\nSide note: I was previously in an abusive romantic relationship and was also abused in my childhood by men. My bf knows this. So I was trying to explain to him that I didn\\'t actually think he\\'d hurt me. That its not a stab towards him, but when men get loud or make statements like that, it brings back memories and I freak out.\\xa0\\n\\n  \\nHe still didn\\'t get it. Scoffed and said something like \"You can probably stop assuming I\\'m going to physically harm you\". I told him that this statement reminded me of \\'thanks i\\'m cured\\' and that it wasn\\'t that easy. When I asked what he meant by his \"You\\'re lucky all I did was bark an order at you\" statement then, he said \"I could have barked 2 orders. I could have barked 3 orders..\"\\xa0\\n\\n  \\nAt the end of it, we agreed that if this happened again, that he should just reassure me that he didn\\'t mean it like that and that he\\'d never hurt me. He seemed annoyed by this, but agreed.\\xa0\\n\\n  \\nHonestly, I\\'m looking for some perspective. I felt like I was the reason for ruining our whole night. I know that because I have had certain experiences, I tend to panic in situations that may not warrant it. Were the statements he made actually threatening, or did I blow this out of proportion? I know I was shaking his desk and had an attitude, but I just feel like I didn\\'t deserve 100% of the guilt. AITA?\\n\\n  \\nI especially want to hear from people who have been with someone who has lived with abuse. Were you offended when your partner got scared or overreacted to something you said/did?

She's in her 40s and  has never had success in her career. It's not entirely her fault, but  she takes it out on other people. I'm younger and things have gone  better for me, but she thinks that I can help her in ways that I can't.  Years ago my intern (a woman) was hired into a full-time job. My sister  was furious over this and said I should have given her the job. My  sister wasn't qualified for it, my intern had a relevant Masters degree,  and my sister lived 3000 miles away. Years later, I left that job and began dating my former co-worker. We're still dating.\\n\\n(My sis and I have talked about that job. 1 time she seemed to acknowledge that it was the right decision.)\\n\\nLast  July my sis &amp; nephew came to visit. My nephew is among my favorite  people in the world and we play all kinds of games every time we're  together. The first few days went OK.\\n\\nOne  afternoon we were on a pier dancing to a jazz band and having a good  time. My GF joined us, and as soon as she showed up my sister shut down.  She didn't say hi to her, didn't acknowledge her presence, just looked  straight through her. We walked 10 minutes to a restaurant and she  wouldn't say a thing to her the whole time. In the restaurant my GF was  seated immediately across from her. My sister still wouldn't acknowledge  her. My GF felt so awkward and insulted that she made up an excuse and  left. (My GF &amp; my sis have met a few times before w/o incident.)\\n\\nI  was livid. After my nephew went to bed I told my sister how angry I  was. She said I that I had no empathy for her and said that my GF would  never get an apology. She left town a couple days later (earlier than  planned) and we haven't spoken since. That was 9 months ago.\\n\\nThis  past week included the bdays of my sis and nephew. I sent him a note  and a gift and I included a short letter to my sister saying that I  wanted her to be a part of my life, and that I hoped we could treat the  people in both of our lives with respect. I didn't call my nephew  though, bc I didn't want to go through my sister. This is the first time  I haven't spoken to him on his bday. My sister never responded to the  letter, and that was 2 weeks ago. (I sent the gift early.)\\n\\nThe  day after my nephew's bday I learned (from my dad) that my sister  needed $150 to take her dog to the vet. I sent my dad $300 and told him  to give it to my sis. He suggested I include a card, but I've already  written her a letter to which she hadn't responded, so I'm not sending a  card.\\n\\nNow  it's been 5 days. I haven't heard from my sister. I'd like to speak to  her and to my nephew. And I'd like her to apologize to my GF. I know  that if I call her she's gonna give me a hard time about not calling my  nephew.\\n\\nShould I call her?

I suggested that I should receive a small cut if they sign a deal. My wife thinks that\\'s not what friends do.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFull version: this weekend I was helping out with some manual work to my wife\\'s friend, let\\'s call him David. In a month he wants to leave his day job and start his real estate enterprise, which would involve finding apartments, buying them, finishing them up himself (or renovating) and either selling them for a higher price or furnishing them and renting their rooms. I\\'m no expert in it but he does seem to know his thing and, from what my wife tells me, David and David\\'s wife are quite the venturesome types. Even though they have two small kids, they also started a small side-business a few years ago (while also working full-time jobs) which they intend to sell in a year or two to focus on real estate. David is looking for investors, since he doesn\\'t yet have the financial capacity to buy multiple apartments himself and really kick it off.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAfter hearing this, I reached out to an old friend of mine, let\\'s call him George. George been very successful in the past 15 years and is definitely a millionaire, likely a multimillionaire by now. He\\'s by far the smartest person with money that I know. He\\'s been a good friend of mine but we don\\'t live in close vicinity so nowadays we see each other 2-3 times a year and speak too little on the phone for me not to have a guilty conscious about it. Anyway, during the past few years, he also started to invest in real estate but doesn\\'t know our local market. He invests mostly abroad and if it\\'s local, he lives in a completely different part of the country anyway so he focuses on his operations there.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBoth gentlemen seemed very keen in talking to each other. If not to strike a deal then at least to exchange experiences. George is starting very slowly, since he\\'s currently got his main business to run and David wants to go all in within the next few months but is only on his first investment now. So, they\\'re both learning their new trade. Therefore, I connected them - exchanging their email addresses and phone numbers.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI did mention to David that if they strike a deal, I\\'ll probably be wanting a small cut, like 1000 USD. He replied with something along the lines of, \"of course, that\\'s obvious.\" However, my wife does think ITA because that\\'s not what friends should do and literally forbids me to bring it up again because she would feel ashamed by it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI do think that I would sort of be an a-hole if I would demand, say, a 0,5% cut out of their every invoice. But a small amount like that? Considering they might even be buying a few apartments a year and David might become business-independent way faster with George\\'s funding in his first years? That doesn\\'t really seem anything more than symbolic.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, AITA?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nPS. My first ever post on reddit \\\\^\\\\^ Up to this point, I was only lurking.

We have 2 other kids in the house, both of whom are pretty demanding due to being on the spectrum/mental health issues. We have a stable income and live in a well to do middle class area with good schools etc. My SO and I always discussed having 1 more child, especially one close in age to our youngest who is almost 3. Our 3yo is suspected to be on the spectrum but diagnosis pending until she’s a bit older. I have been unable to work for the past year due to severe depression and chronic anxiety. I am medicated and in long term treatment but still highly symptomatic. I’m also a “reactive drinker”. When my mental health spirals, I tend to want to escape into a bottle (or 3) of wine. I don’t get drunk in front of the kids but it does upset my SO. He and I both actively monitor my drinking and I hold myself accountable to him and my counselor about what and how much I drink. It’s an openly discussed problem and I am using my support network to improve. When I’m not depressed, I don’t drink to excess. \\n\\nI am pro choice and am considering whether or not I should terminate this pregnancy.

He was very suspicious and I lied to him saying I didn’t hook up with anyone sexually and no one raped me. I felt like I wasn’t lying because 1.) a penis did not rape me and 2.) I did not hook up with anyone sexually, someone USED and VIOLATED me and it was not consensual. Something in me could not take responsibility. At that point, it felt like it didn’t even happen to me.

My mom obviously liked him, though, so I happily included him as part of the \\'family\\' sphere. \\n\\nAbout a year ago, though, I got the worst phone call in the history of phone calls. My mother was in tears, and told me she and Kyle had gotten into an argument and it had ended with him getting physical. I gave her as much help and support as possible, letting her know she could always stay with me if she needed to be somewhere safe/away, walking her through potential next steps, etc. I\\'d escaped from an abusive situation before with her help, so I was more than willing to do anything I could to return the favor and help her move on\\n\\nHowever, as foreshadowed with my use of the word \"current\" to describe his relationship with my mother, she ended up back with him. \\n\\nI obviously disagree with her decision (the incident above was the only physical altercation, but there had been previous red flags; it wasn\\'t a total one-off) and have expressed as much to her, but she wants to continue to be with him and there\\'s no way for me to persuade her otherwise. I\\'m met with the usual tropes of someone going back to an abuser: \"he\\'s changed\" \"I forgive him\" \"that was a long time ago\" \"this is different\" \"he was drunk and not in his right mind\" \"it hasn\\'t happened since\", which concern me, but at the end of the day she\\'s an adult and makes her own decisions about who she sees, and I recognize I don\\'t really get a say. \\n\\nI do, however, feel like I should get a say in who *I* spend my time with. So I set clear limits: I will not be present anywhere that Kyle is also present. I will not visit her at her house if he\\'s home, I will not let her into mine if he\\'s with her, I will not attend family functions if he is attending.

So at the start of the relationship we had every day together pretty much, and there’s no other problem in the relationship we get along perfectly fine and are happy every time we’re together. But a lot of things happened to change that. So one, she developed a lot of depression that made her hard to be around so I went from maybe 5 days a week with her to 3. Then (we’re juniors in High School) my dog “bit” her and her mom freaked out and said she can’t ever be at my house again. So our availability to see her was cut in half because now we can only see each other when I can go to her house. Then my friend Q was abused by his uncle (he has no parents) and forced out of home so I took him in so I got less time with her. Then I got hired like 3 days ago because I have a lot of liabilities like car insurance and a fat ass traffic ticket I need to get taken care of. So now we literally only get time in school to hang out. She ignored me in our English class and when I asked her what was wrong exploded on me saying we don’t get any time and she feels like I’m not even important to her. I love her and wish we could have all the time in the world (I told her this). But I don’t think we’ll even be able to see each other outside of school for probably a week and a half. I don’t know if I should still keep trying to keep her happy or just let her go free to be with someone who can be there for her. This dilemma is keeping me up at night.

She forgave him and took him back and wants me to accept him as part of the family again. I refuse.

We have a really good relationship and pretty much always have (besides the usual bumpy bits that happen between teenage daughters and their mums), and I love and look up to her. \\n\\nShe met her current SO(Kyle) when I was in college, so he and I didn\\'t really \\'bond\\' in a father-daughter sort of way. My mom obviously liked him, though, so I happily included him as part of the \\'family\\' sphere. \\n\\nAbout a year ago, though, I got the worst phone call in the history of phone calls. My mother was in tears, and told me she and Kyle had gotten into an argument and it had ended with him getting physical. I gave her as much help and support as possible, letting her know she could always stay with me if she needed to be somewhere safe/away, walking her through potential next steps, etc. I\\'d escaped from an abusive situation before with her help, so I was more than willing to do anything I could to return the favor and help her move on\\n\\nHowever, as foreshadowed with my use of the word \"current\" to describe his relationship with my mother, she ended up back with him. \\n\\nI obviously disagree with her decision (the incident above was the only physical altercation, but there had been previous red flags; it wasn\\'t a total one-off) and have expressed as much to her, but she wants to continue to be with him and there\\'s no way for me to persuade her otherwise. At the end of the day she\\'s an adult and makes her own decisions about who she sees, and I recognize I don\\'t really get a say. \\n\\nI do, however, feel like I should get a say in who *I* spend my time with. So I set clear limits: I will not be present anywhere that Kyle is also present. She is *always* welcome on her own, and I am happy to be with her anywhere and any time he isn\\'t. I will even go out of my way to work plans around avoiding him at the price of my own convenience. \\n\\nI\\'m not trying to punish her, this is really for my own mental health. Facing someone who hits a lot of the same qualities of *my* abuser and having to play nice is not something I can do, especially when it\\'s someone I love so dearly that would be on the other end of it. \\n\\n\\nThis has put a serious strain on our relationship and I know it breaks her heart, and came to a head when I didn\\'t spend Christmas with her because of him (this is the first time I haven\\'t gone home for Christmas).

I tried to be nice at school but in the end she turned out to be exactly the person everyone told me she was (somewhat toxic, really narcissistic.)

Since then she’s been causing a lot of problems. For example when the assistant manager called her out on charging too much and stealing products, X went straight to the manager and said she felt “attacked.” Most recently our manager created a “chore chart” for us. We don’t get paid to do these things. If it was stuff that I should be doing anyways like cleaning up after myself it would be fine but it’s things that take at least 1+ hour of time that I’m not getting paid to do. So when I was talking about it to another coworker of mine X overheard us and went straight to the manager and told her basically everything we said.

Just the way I am. He started going through struggles about 10 months ago, and at that time, I lived in the same city as him (I\\'ve since moved to Los Angeles and he is in Toronto). When I was in Toronto, I made every effort to spend time with him, and I even stuck my neck out for him to get him his DREAM job. And I mean DREAM job. I got him a job at a video editor working for a video game company when he had 0 video editing experience. They hired him purely out of my word.

It\\'s exhausting to engage in these arguments, so I tend to choose \"the silent treatment\": I\\'ll stop responding entirely, or I\\'ll say \"Don\\'t worry about it/It\\'s not important\", or I\\'ll ask for time to myself to cool down, or I\\'ll simply walk away.\\n\\n\\nI want to stress that I don\\'t do this to be condescending or passive-aggressive. I honestly just hate wasting time arguing, and I also have an annoying habit of crying when I\\'m angry/frustrated. Also, I don\\'t immediately shut down every single time I\\'m faced with the slightest confrontation- I\\'m more than willing to talk things out with anybody. It\\'s specifically with James that I can\\'t be bothered to go back and forth with. He has told me on multiple occasions that I am \"too emotional\" and he doesn\\'t know how to deal with it (he credits this to his autism). Whenever he says that it makes me all the more unwilling to share how I feel.\\n\\nExample: Last weekend we were cleaning up after dinner at James\\' place when I accidentally knocked over a water pitcher. I immediately apologized and began cleaning up but he instantly flew into a rage, accusing me of being careless/clumsy/lazy, and a lot of other hurtful things. I tried to defend myself but couldn\\'t get a word in edgewise, so I fell silent and cleaned the mess without speaking to him. He demanded I speak to him but I said I had nothing to say, which made him angrier. He later tried to hug me but I asked him to please give me space as I was still feeling hurt.\\n\\nLater, he apologized and retracted the hurtful things he said (he rarely has blow ups like this but his mental illnesses make it difficult for him to control his emotions), but admitted it was incredibly annoying that I always \"freeze him out\" rather than facing things head on. I apologized as well for that because I do see his perspective, but I also told honestly him there wouldn\\'t have been any point in trying to reason with him because he gets so irrational and defensive. \\n\\nAITA for prefering to go silent?', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 618448, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'top', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for choosing \"the silent treatment\" in arguments?', 'updated_utc': 1554492262, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b84qyr/aita_for_choosing_the_silent_treatment_in/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

Honestly I think it was fluke. I’m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\\n\\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She’s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn’t and still don’t mind, it’s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn’t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don’t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \\n\\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn’t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \\n\\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn’t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I’m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don’t know how but I did. \\n\\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she’s been crying and solemn and sad. She’s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She’s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn’t been herself. I haven’t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn’t get in because she didn’t). \\n\\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it’s Cornell. I couldn’t in a million years imagine I’d get in. I’ve been researching obsessively about it and I can’t shake the desire that if I don’t go, I’ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it’s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \\n\\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don’t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she’s worked compared to me...\\n\\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn’t. She’s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho.

One of them was a man closer to 30 finishing up his college degree. Initially he seemed ok, we asked him questions about college, jobs, just normal future questions you’d ask say a teacher.\\n\\nWell fasts forward my friend began speaking to him more and it went from school to flirting. I was pretty weirded out but figured, hey it’s a grown man, she probably says they’re flirting but it’s not and I told her to be careful. Well they got together a few months before she turned legal.\\n\\nI had a lot of red flags going off in my head. And I warned her again but again I never got directly involved for months when their relationship began. I was only there when she complained and talked about him. From what she told me he had gotten out of a long committed relationship a while back ago, he convinced her to start drinking, smoking, having sex, which in itself isn’t totally bad if you’re doing it safe because let’s be honest, high schoolers are curious dumb shits. But what worried me was that in all the time I’ve known her, she had constantly told us her faith won’t let her and that she’s loyal to her God and would never betray her parents who I’m not gonna lie, were pretty damn strict. She threw that out the window pretty quickly.\\n\\nShe would take him with her whenever we hung out. It was weird that a grown man was hanging out with high school girls even if he was claiming he was trying to get to know his girlfriend’s friends better. At this point I had tried to subtlety tell her that I didn’t trust him, or how it was strange he couldn’t even wait until she turned legal, when she brought up problems she had with him or the wild behavior she began exhibiting. I never ever said anything while she gushed about him and I didn’t know she had been relaying my words to him every time I said something until finally she told one of our mutual friends that she and her boyfriend thought I needed to get my head out of my ass and not be so jealous over their relationship and stop being delusional. There were also a few more hurtful choice words said to me that I rather not repeat. I told them then and there that I refused to speak to her and him and stand by my statement that it’s fucking weird they’re dating.\\n\\nIt’s been a couple of years since then, haven’t spoken to her at all but we’re still in the same friend group. They’re still together, a little bit on and off. My friends and I recently agreed to meet on a certain date and because our schedules are so busy, it’s really rare that we all get together. However she wants to come and bring her boyfriend too and I told my friends I was still uncomfortable and possibly not attend if she’s there with him. Not to mention while a larger chunk of my conscious agrees their relationship is really weird, another part of me is beginning to doubt if I was wrong about him since they’re still together after so long. My friends are begging me to come saying I can just avoid him and that they’ve changed but honestly after the horrible things they both said about me not even to my face with no apology and the fact that they don’t think anything was wrong with him pursuing a 17 year old when he was almost 30, I don’t want to bless them with my presence or even text them. Friends might not be calling me an asshole to my face but I can tell some of them are disappointed in me.\\n\\nSo AITA for not wanting to even give them, especially him, a chance and possibly miss the one chance my friends and I get to gather?', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 618550, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for purposefully avoiding my friend and her boyfriend', 'updated_utc': 1554492682, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b8522p/aita_for_purposefully_avoiding_my_friend_and_her/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

Until last month. My dad slipped up, which led to my mom slipping up too. So every morning when they leave I get frustrated bc They say they will be back shortly. It’s always shortly. So I could be sitting here for 5 minutes or 2 hours waiting for them to get back. Well, this morning everyone was out of cigarettes and they left without saying anything. So I called and asked when they’d be back. Can you guess what the answer was? Yeah, Shortly. Fair enough. I made a pot of coffee, checked on my son, and sat down at the kitchen table to waste time until they get back. After 45 minutes I call again asking when exactly “shortly” will be and they say they don’t know. I ask if they have any half cigs or anything in their room and they say no, alright I sighed and said okay. Then my dad jumps all over me for my “attitude”. Which really upset me because generally my dad does not snap at me or yell at me so I started crying bc I really didn’t mean to sound snappy or anything. I was just getting irritated at not having my morning cig yet. \\n\\n  So, my dad comes home and after they’re done doing their thing he tells me to come here and says I need to stop snapping at him when my morning doesn’t go “perfectly”. Now, I’ll admit I can totally be a bitch in the morning. It’s been a problem for a while, but since getting on antidepressants and trying to manage my feelings it’s much less of an issue. So thismade me feel worse because I’ve really been trying to just do my thing in the morning and try to not be a mega Bitch. But then he goes off on a tangent about how after “one slip up” we kids write him off and distance ourselves. This “slip up” has been going on for over a month now. I listed off every thing I had to go through in the last 10 years that stemmed from their drug use and not being able to care for us. I told him how every other “slip up” ends up with him or them both in jail or on the streets. I guess now I’m kinda starting to ramble, but am I the asshole for sometimes getting an attitude regarding their “slip ups” and distancing myself from them when they happen?? I’m moving into my own apartment with my son within the month. But if they get strung out and lose the house I’ll have my son, and 2 teenage brothers to care for.  I don’t want to have to be responsible for my brothers, but I also don’t want them to end up in foster care. \\n\\nTL;DR: my parents are heroin addicts and get mad when I get an attitude regarding their habits and the fact that if this “slip up” continues and they get strung out I’ll have not only my son to care for but also my 2 teen brothers.

I'm worried because, well.... M is a fucking train wreck. Let me explain: l already feel like a complete cunt to say this because things were never good into M's home (her family is a disaster) and seeing this l can just say that I can understand why she acts the way she act but..... Let me give some examples. She totally lack common sense. \\nShe doesn't understand money. If she has some cash she will just waste it on useless stuff (she bought a dog without even having a house) and complain because she doesn't have it anymore and she is poor. \\nShe has very bad higyen issues. Due to her family life she used to live in total squalor, and she is incapable of tell filthy from clean :in her old house she NEVER changed her sheets, picked up her dog's crap ,  washed anything and seldom changed her clothes ( her reasoning: they aren't stained, so they are clean); while I'm sorry for this, I'm concerned for my friend: her health is pretty frail, and she is often ill, plus she is a very tidy person. And these are the smallest things. \\nIf  there is a poster girl of too dumb to live, that's M. She doesn't understand that crossing the road without watching is dangerous just like she doesn't understand that unprotected sex leads to pregnancies: she already has had two abortions (I'm not against it, just.... Why when you could use condoms and avoid stds?????) and still asks us if having sex while standing on top can lead to a pregnancy or if you can get pregnant giving a bj.  Until now,  you can think of her like a sad tragic Kevina, but the real issue are her acquaintances: she is a bad people magnet. Robbers, junkies, drug dealers are her friends, and she will bring them with her if you let her move into your house.  two of my friends have let her in: they houses have been robbed, damaged or used as a brothel  ( ah, M was being pimped by her boyfriend. She said that since she was his gf it wasn't pimping). They even found two  needles. She also gave to her friends the keys of the houses without consulting my friends first (both the times).  they were forced to change their locks, and received anonymous death threats for this, and one of them was also punched in the face by one of M's friends that did not want to leave. She still couldn't understand why they kicked her out, since she wasn't the one that did drugs or stole. The point is: I'm sure M will just die or be sold as a sex slave or something if someone doesn't help her, but I'm terrified that something could happen to F.

TL;DR at bottom. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nMy friend has always been overweight. I have been in fairly decent shape throughout our friendship, but have gained about 15 pounds in the past couple years. It kind of crept up on me and I didn’t realize it until a few months ago, when I weighed myself with the scale in her bathroom on a whim (I don’t own one). I was shocked at the number and told her about it. I immediately took steps to eat healthier, joined a gym, and started walking on my lunch- and 15-minute breaks at work (I have a sedentary office job). \\n\\n&amp;nbsp; \\n\\nI’ve mentioned these lifestyle changes here and there (for example: she called me while I was driving and I answered on speakerphone; she asked where I was going and I said the gym. Or we had a conversation about developing healthy hobbies and I told her exercise is becoming a habit for me, but not a hobby yet). My friend confided in me she was feeling bad about herself because of how much weight she’s gained, so I offered to bring her to the gym with me. She declined (for legitimate reasons: she has a foot condition that makes even walking painful, and my gym doesn’t have a pool). I’ve been cooking a lot and have invited her over to share some healthy meals with me. (I didn’t put it that way, I just invited her over for a meal or offered her food when we were hanging out, and I don’t make unhealthy food anymore.)\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nI still don’t own a scale and there isn’t one at my gym. I think it’s better to focus on being healthy and not obsess about the numbers, so I have decided not to buy one. I’ve been over her house several times since this lifestyle change and chose not to weigh myself. But last night I gave into temptation and weighed myself on her scale. I was excited to see I’ve lost four pounds! I shared the good news with her and she seemed happy for me. After a fair amount of drinking, she got really upset at our other friend for paying more attention to “the cute skinny girl” than her and had a bit of a meltdown. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp; \\n\\nI talked it out with her and she told me it’s upsetting to hear me talk about weight gain when I’m so much smaller than her. I listened to her, told her I understood that I wasn’t being respectful of her body image hangups, and apologized. But this morning I found myself wondering: Am I really the asshole? She didn’t tell me my comments were upsetting her until she started yelling and crying.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nTL;DR: I told my overweight friend I lost four pounds.

One of them was a man closer to 30 finishing up his college degree. Initially he seemed ok, we asked him questions about college, jobs, just normal future questions you’d ask say a teacher.\\n\\nWell fasts forward my friend began speaking to him more and it went from school to flirting. I was pretty weirded out but figured, hey it’s a grown man, she probably says they’re flirting but it’s not and I told her to be careful. Well they got together a few months before she turned legal.\\n\\nI had a lot of red flags going off in my head. And I warned her again but again I never got directly involved for months when their relationship began. What she told me was that he had gotten out of a long committed relationship a while back ago, he convinced her to start drinking, smoking, having sex, which in itself isn’t totally bad. But what worried me was that in all the time I’ve known her, she had constantly told us her faith won’t let her and that she’s loyal to her God and would never betray her parents who I’m not gonna lie, were pretty damn strict. She threw that out the window pretty quickly.\\n\\nShe would take him with her whenever we hung out. It was weird that a grown man was hanging out with high school girls even if he was claiming he was trying to get to know his girlfriend’s friends better. I told her again I was uncomfortable with him and she in turn told one of our mutual friends that she and her boyfriend thought I needed to get my head out of my ass and not be so jealous over their relationship and stop being delusional. There were also a few more hurtful choice words said to me that I rather not repeat and we haven’t spoken since. \\n\\nIt’s been a couple of years since then, but we’re still in the same friend group. They’re still together, a little bit on and off. My friends and I recently agreed to meet on a certain date and because our schedules are so busy, it’s really rare that we all get together. However she wants to come and bring her boyfriend too and I told my friends I possibly will not attend if she’s there with him. A larger chunk of my conscious agrees their relationship is really weird, another part of me is beginning to doubt if I was wrong about him since they’re still together after so long. My friends want me to come but I can’t forget the horrible things they both said about me not even to my face with no apology and the fact that they don’t think anything was wrong with him pursuing a 17 year old when he was almost 30. Friends might not be calling me an asshole to my face but I can tell some of them are disappointed in me.\\n\\nSo AITA for not wanting to even give them, especially him, a chance and possibly miss the one chance my friends and I get to gather?\\n', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 618595, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'top', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for not wanting to give my (ex)friend and her boyfriend a chance', 'updated_utc': 1554492824, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b858bi/aita_for_not_wanting_to_give_my_exfriend_and_her/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

This Akita was to my knowledge the runt of the litter. His name is Titus.\\n\\nTitus, like the other dogs we have, is essentially affixed to my mother. He follows her around constantly, seldom taking the time to leave her out of his sight and do his own thing.\\n\\nThe average lifespan of an Akita is 10-12 years. He is the equivalent of a 90 year old, by this metric.\\n\\nNow the actual scenario: Due to his advanced age, Titus has been quite immobile and lethargic, usually laying down most of the time. He hasn’t been able to do much of anything recently, and his health has rapidly degraded. We moved to a new house a few days ago, which probably has him stressed out. He has been trying to constantly follow my mother around incessantly, however, he has been hurting trying to do so. He won’t ever lay down to rest, and I’m guessing is because he has a joint problem.\\n\\nHis health has been rapidly deteriorating. My parents want to put him down. I do not.\\n\\nThey think that, due to the misery he is in, he had a long and good life and is ready to die. They think it’s time for him to be put down so that he doesn’t have to live in misery anymore.\\n\\nI think that he needs to go to the vet first, and to be firmly adjusted to the new environment of the new house. The symptoms he has been experiencing is, I believe, expected for the nature of the scenario. I think he needs to be more thoroughly examined by a vet and receive proper treatment to improve the quality of his life, instead of heading to the last resort. She ended up making a full recovery. I think that Titus can make it at least several months more with a proper treatment.\\n\\nHowever, my parents think that this is just me being attached, and as a result, my desire for him to live means he has to live in misery. For some reason, they are totally opposed to getting him veterinary treatment. My father thinks that because he breeds Akitas, that he is familiar with their physiology and is adept in addressing health issues for them. He has been relatively successful up until this point.

Our relationship is very new, and I've never dated anyone with a child before. I told my boyfriend that this was new to me, and he understood: He said he knew that dating would be a challenge after having Ty because most people our age don't have kids yet. Long story short, I haven't met Ty yet for a few reasons: (1) My boyfriend isn't quite ready for me to; (2) Ty has a loving, able Mom that he lives with full-time; and (3) I'm not personally ready.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and Ty's mom had a not-so-fun break up after Ty's birth, but tried to make it work together for a while. They eventually called it quits for good because they just argued constantly. Even so, they communicate regularly regarding Ty and co-parenting. So, it's not like Ty needs another mom.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I are getting dragged by people in our lives because they think that I should either assume an automatic stepmom role, or that my boyfriend should break up with me to find someone who will do that. Am I selfish, or is that insane? We've just been dating very recently! I think it is positively insane for anyone to expect me to go on 5 dates with a guy and then immediately assume the role of stepmom to his kid-- who, again, already has a perfectly capable, loving mother. And I also think it's insane for anyone to expect him to break up with a girl who already took a leap of faith to date a Father just because she isn't immediately ready, at age 23, to take on the lifelong commitment of being a stepparent.\\n\\nIf we'd been dating for 5 years, or were planning on getting engaged, or something- I would feel way differently. I love babies and kids and think stepfamilies can absolutely work and be beautiful. But I'm 23, the relationship is brand new, and I feel like the expectations for my boyfriend and I are way too high- and he agrees. Lastly, if I was Ty's biological mom, I wouldn't feel too comfortable with my ex's new girlfriend coming around, so I also am trying to be careful not to step on her toes and respect her.\\n\\nAre my boyfriend and I the bad guys here?

I have a teammate, we\\'ll call him \"X\" and he has been causing me problems constantly. I think of myself as a pretty nice person, I have my moments but in general at least on my swim team I try to be encouraging and supportive of my friends after they have a bad race or a I congratulate them after a good one, regardless of personal opinion of them. X does not seem to know how to be genuine, ever. After bad races he\\'ll things along the lines of, \"wow your slow\" or \"you suck.\" He always says he\\'s joking afterwards but it still frustrates me because I do nothing but encourage and support him. I won\\'t deny it, he is a good swimmer and swims mainly the 50 free and 100 free, effectively making him the polar opposite of me regarding our respective events. He has a massive ego and he constantly tells me that he could beat me in my events even though I\\'ve proven time and time again that I\\'m better at them. Even my coach told him that I\\'d kick his ass after a 50 in the 500, 1000 and 1500. Also, my other teammates who are pretty chill most of the time become sort of douchebags when they are around him. I give him rides, pretty consistently to and from practice and I feel like he is taking advantage of me because he doesn\\'t treat me well at all and I don\\'t want to deal with his bullshit anymore. Another issue is that we share a lot of the same friends so no matter what I\\'m going to around him.

I\\'ve only seen a small handful of some of the more recent Marvel movies and that was only because my old boyfriend at the time was also a big Marvel fan, though nowhere near as bad as this new guy.

She would ignore texts, just stuff like that.\\n\\nSo we decided that we'd just start doing stuff together, and not worry about Emma anymore.

But here we go.  \\n\\n\\nI'm getting married this year, and my fiance and I are super excited. I got all the big ticket items paid for and ready to go, and all my girls have their dresses and will look phenomenal in them. Everything was going great until my one bridesmaid posted a picture of her newest tattoo...and now I am slightly mortified that it could end up in my wedding photos.  \\n\\n\\nNow all my bridesmaids have multiple tattoos. I have nothing against theirs, or any tattoos for that matter. And honestly if I wasn't a chickenshit, I'd have a few myself (but needles freak me out so it's a hard no for me). So why am I thinking of singling out one bridesmaid for her one tattoo? Well. It looks like a giant..veiny..penis. My mother saw it, immediately called me and asked WTF it was, my MOH texted me asking why she got a dick tattooed and a few other bridesmaids contacted me asking what the hell was going on.  \\n\\n\\nThe idea that she was going for was adorable, especially because it signifies her kid's birthday. Think baby Dumbo being held in her mothers trunk. But it's not what it looks like at all. It looks like the side profile of a headless penis. And it's lightly outlined in pink and blues, so it looks like veins. And the trunk is detailed so it looks wrinkly and overall just a poor execution on what would have been a fantastic tattoo. Now if it didn't resemble male genitals I wouldn't care. But it's a big piece and in a highly visible spot that will be in almost every single photo. I just don't want a big penis in my final wedding photos.  \\n\\n\\nSo Reddit, would I be the asshole if I asked her to cover it up?

We both agreed that diamonds were a pricey, so we would get something else. I told him we could make anything special. He heard that I didn’t need a ring at all. He was getting a bonus the next month that was more than I made last year, and we had combined our finances, so the budget was reasonable. I also really wanted to do it in as fair and equitable a way as possible, because I know that trying to buy a ring is a lot of stress on guys.\\n\\nHe didn't buy a place holder, and used his mom’s old scratched costume ring. I took about a month to think about what I wanted, and was ready to make an appointment to go have it made at my family jeweler. He told me that we would get something made where we live. He would tell me he was down to buy it anytime, and even talked about upping the budget without me asking, but never did it with me. I told him it was really important to me that we buy it together, that it was an important symbol for me, and that I didn't want to just go to a store by myself and swipe my card. He never really seemed to get it. Finally, I got so sick of trying to get him to do it with me that I bought a cheap ring, that broke 3 weeks later.\\n\\nIt really hurt my feelings, especially given that I asked for something modest and told him it was important to me. We talked about what happened, and I told him it made me feel like he didn't want to marry me. He told me he was worried about money, even though we both agree that the worry was pretty irrational given the circumstance. It didn't make me feel unloved because I don't have a huge ring, it made me feel unloved because he didn't listen to me. I felt bad because he ignored something that meant a lot to me.\\n\\nSo we talked about it, and agreed to think about a diamond since at this point I don't want to get a colored stone that will show wear and do this again in 5 years.

I didn’t get much response from SM and Dad except for an “ok”. 9 hours after I had sent the first text, I get a text asking me if I could change our wedding day. \\nSM told me she wasn’t sure Dad could get the days off (he had already said he would), so I texted him to confirm that he would be able to get our wedding day off. He said of course, I told SM who then said “you didn’t consult with us on the date, and we have two other weddings in April plus a grad in June. You should move the wedding back to June because it would be better for us. Since you didn’t consult with us, your sister can’t be at the wedding. If you move your wedding she’d be there.” I told SM that we had consulted with them, and that if they were going to struggle with the costs of the wedding, we would move to the FREE church, and we would pay for the decorations ourselves, and FILs were ok with paying for flowers and reception food. She refused. \\nSM said that it was unfair to our extended family who HAVE /s to buy gifts for us because all our weddings are close together. Most of the things on our registry are around $20 or less with a few bigger things around $50. \\n \\nIn the end we decided not to change our date, and that has caused tension between my parents and us. I’m curious as to whether IATA in this situation or not, because I think about it a lot. Thanks. \\n \\nTl;dr\\nMy dad and Stepmom approved our wedding date, but when I booked the ceremony venue I was told I needed to change it because of sister and other family issues.

My brother and I are still Christian as it is what we grew up believing (I feel we have become atheists since we dont go to church and my father who is also Christian we only visit once every 2 weeks) since my mom met her boyfriend she has converted to Muslim for him (this does not bother me). My mom is also vegan. My mother also does not cook we have a helper who cooks for us ( not Muslim)\\n\\n\\nMain:\\n\\nI fight with my mother over what we buy when we go shopping. We cant buy bacon anymore even though it will only be for me and my brother (she is not hardcore Islamic we still eat pork when we are at restaurants with her). We dont buy normal meat at the shop anymore we have to drive to a Muslim butcher and buy meat there (dont really care ) . This has become a problem as when I visited my father the food my stepmom cooks taste different. I think it's the difference of the meat as most of what she uses like pork and mixed sausages (my favorite) are not halaal. When I told my mother why cant we just buy meat at the normal shop just for me and my brother she says the halaal meat won't taste different but she doesn't even know as she has been vegan for 3 years now. It also irritates the living hell out of me whenever I ask for something and her first response is 'is it halaal', I understand it may not be halaal but it would just be for me or my brother. She says her boyfriend might find it rude but she never even asked him and I dont see why her new believe requires me to give up bacon.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n2 weeks ago I asked if we can get frozen pizza it's not halaal I told her she then she says no. I asked her why not it would just be for me and my brother she says no louder and gives me a glance (the glance said a lot) I felt like if I asked her agian I would get my ass whooped in front of all the other shoppers.\\n\\nI'm I an asshole for thinking this way? Or should I just learn to live with this? \\n\\nIt won't kill me if I have to give up eating pork but it won't kill her either to allow me and my brother to still enjoy it\\n\\nI love my mother and respect her choice I just need to know if I'm an asshole for feeling like I'm entitled to get what I want\\n\\n(My first post)\\n\", 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 618974, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA: I fight over what food we buy at the supermarket because my mom converted to Muslim and says everything has to be halaal now.', 'updated_utc': 1554494151, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b86jj8/aita_i_fight_over_what_food_we_buy_at_the/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

Quite frankly I wanted to add that I wanted him to get his life together and utilize his time spent in a great living situation to better his life because he can\\'t be here forever, and he could pick up a reliable car to drive to these meetings if he handled his finances differently, but it was too long of a convo, wasn\\'t my business, and my partner wasn\\'t present. \\n\\nAnd to be clear, he\\'s the type of guy to say he\\'s gonna be rich by 30, drive nice cars, have nice things. And I hate to see him wasting his 20s not setting himself up, spending more money on weed than savings. There\\'s really nothing basic he has to come out of pocket for on his own outside his heavily discounted rent. He\\'s already wasted $2k paying off an iPhone (another scheme that targets people with bad credit). Providing free transport to what my partner and I feel is a genuine waste of time feels like enabling him to waste away the time he has in a really lucky situation. Their parents are 100% hands off financially jic anyone asks.\\n\\nWe\\'re not his parents trying to control him but is pretty disappointing watching someone waste away the time they have in a stable situation. And if anything, it could encourage him to make his own money so he can get a car to get himself around \\n\\nAITA for being okay with him taking my car to his job a few minutes away, but only occasionally with seeing his friends and not at all for going to his pyramid scheme side hustle?\\n\\n', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 619014, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'top', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for not letting my [24F] brother-in-law [24M] take my car to his pyramid scheme meetings?', 'updated_utc': 1554494213, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b86nhm/aita_for_not_letting_my_24f_brotherinlaw_24m_take/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

Nancy asks if her husband Dale can move in with their dogs for a newly negotiated rate. This was a few weeks into the tenancy. We agree on a rate for the increase in utilities, and Dale moves in with the dogs.It is noteworthy here that Nancy works contract positions all around the country. Generally, Dale will stay home while Nancy does this. In this new arrangement, Dale will continue to live here for the newly negotiated rate when Nancy leaves to do her next contract.\\n\\nNancy has some trouble with her car, I help to fix it, but she insists on taking it to the dealer instead. For three weeks I help Nancy out with rides to work, its a minor inconvenience but it works with my schedule so its not that big of a deal. For the last week, my wife and I suggest that they borrow our third car that we have been trying to fix up and sell. Its a great car, just has some oil pressure problems we\\'ve been working on diagnosing, so I make sure Dale knows what to do. They get the car back, and we ask them if they want to buy our car for about a third of KBB. It\\'s taking up space and costs of insurance so we want to get rid of it. They indicate they do. From this point forward, Dale borrows our car frequently to run errands. They haven\\'t made any downpayment and we still pay the insurance for it.\\n\\n2 months later, we ask them if they are still serious because we are considering selling it. They say they are, but they don\\'t have the money, and tell us to \"do what we need to do.\"\\n\\nWe decide to list it on Craigslist, this was 4 days later. I ask Dale for the keys and tell him we are selling it. They are surprised. Nancy is upset and tells us that she thought the plan was that she was going to title it in her name, pay insurance, and make payments to us. I didn\\'t know this, but she had a conversation with my wife where Nancy suggested this plan and my wife told her \"We can talk about it.\" Needless to say, we don\\'t like Nancy\\'s plan, and indicate that we would rather just sell the car, payment in full, and be done with it.\\n\\nNancy then tells us that Dale and the dogs will need to move out when she goes to her next gig because the arrangement was contingent upon us furnishing a vehicle for him to drive while he stays with us, since they were going to buy our car. Additionally, he needs this vehicle because they have a dog with a serious medical condition and he needs to be able to take this dog to the vet. I was unaware that the terms of their tenancy were dependent on us providing him with a vehicle, and personally I feel manipulated. I also think its sick that they would hold the well being of this dog over our heads like some bargaining chip.\\n\\nAm I(we) the asshole(s) here?

I have a class three days a week at 8am, so I get up at 7am to brush my teeth/wash my face/get dressed etc. Today was the first day of my new class schedule, so I woke up at 7am, left the room to brush my teeth and wash my face, came back and turned on the lamp in my desk. Because of how the room is set up, in order to avoid the light, anybody in bed would have to turn over to face the wall. I kept my lamp on for light as I got dressed, got ready to go, and then turned off my lamp and left the room. My light was on for maybe 20- 30 mins total. \\n\\nWhen I got back from class, both of roommate were gone. When one of them came back, they said ‘Hey, can you not turn on your lamp in the morning anymore? It wakes me up every time and I can’t fall back asleep.’ Normally, I would completely understand and apologize, and work to find another solution. However, this roommate consistently keeps their lamp on their desk on until 3am, keeping my other roommate and I awake. \\n\\nI told her that I need the light for getting dressed and for getting ready at my desk, and she said ‘you have a flashlight on your phone, just use that!’. She kept talking over me when I was trying to tell her that I didn’t think that was going to work, so finally I said that I would try it the next time I had class, but wasn’t going to guarantee anything. She then said maybe I could look into getting a dimmer lamp instead of the one provided for us by the school in the dorms.  \\n\\nThis roommate isn’t very considerate of either of us that live in this room (giggling until 2am, when all of the lights are off and we are both clearly trying to sleep, refusing to take out the trash, etc), and we have done a lot to accommodate her sleeping schedule. She goes to bed very early in the morning (anywhere from 4am- 6am), then will sleep until the afternoon, once sleeping in until 5pm! During this time, I make sure I am keeping quiet as much as possible, I don’t open the blinds or turn on any over head lights, but my desk lamp if I’m working at my desk. When she says ‘it wakes me up every time’ I know she means when I turn my light on around 9am on weekends or days where I don’t have early classes too. I don’t think it’s fair to ask me to get dressed in the dark, or to sit in the dark until she wakes up so I can finally do something. \\n\\nThe school year is almost done, and despite this, she’s a very dear friend of mine and I don’t want to cause a huge problem if I’m being an asshole.

He's hurt me so badly in the past 8 years and I can't even function as a human being now that I don't have to tiptoe across eggshells watching what I do, what I say, or even think. \\n\\nHe keeps telling me all I need is time to forget everything but the thing is, I can't. So many nights I cried, alone, when I moved out to Arizona to live with him (before), just for him to toss his love around to anybody who would take it. I have never felt pain like that, giving myself to someone  and doing everything to make them happy to have something like this happen. I can't even have friends because he's convinced no matter if it's a dude or a chick, they're out to try and diddle me. The last good friends I made, he forced to just cut them out.\\n\\nThe last straw was from him snapping back at me over a video game. I think I just couldn't take any more at that point and that little tiny thing just set me off. All of the resentment just pushed me out of the door. I have nightmares about everything and hate having to worry about who the next girl that comes into his life is. He also has anger issues and it's extremely unattractive when he has these huge outbursts over small, minuscule things. \\n\\nThis obviously isn't everything, due to character limit, but I just need some input. AITA for not taking him back when he claims he's trying to turn his life around?\\n\\nSummary: Husband, habitual cheater and emotionally abusive partner, claims I just need time to take him back after he only started to get his life together after I called it quits. \\n\\n\", 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 619158, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'top', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for not wanting to go back to my husband?', 'updated_utc': 1554494822, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b876gf/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_back_to_my_husband/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

I also have family in Texas and visit them them too. I\\'ve done this every spring since 2016 and it is the only time I get to spend with my closest friends since we live all over. Its also a chance to visit family I dont see often.\\n\\nThe first year of me and my gf dating (2017), we both had a one week vacation that coincided so no prob there. The 2nd year I talked to her about coming with me for 1 week to stay with family and then the 2nd week just I would stay with my friends. She did not like this and thought i wasn\\'t considering her when making my plans to go. \\n\\nAfter a lot of consideration and talking through it, she was right. It wasn\\'t intentional but was still on me. We talked it out and I apologized. I should have involved her earlier in the process and asked what she thought about the trip before taking the time off of work and buying the tickets.\\n\\nIt was too late to change and she couldn\\'t get the time off. Since I already had booked the flights/time off and my friends and family were expecting me, I ended up going on the trip myself. Usually it is only 1 week so 2 was a lot of time. I  had fun but i realized how I had been wrong and wanted to include my girlfriend on my next trip to Texas. \\n\\nThis year in Jan I brought up doing the trip with her. I made it a point to ask her what she thought and her thoughts on flying down - she doesnt care to travel much and gets anxious about meeting new people so she seemed reserved. I told her that my idea was to go for a week and spend the first half of the vacation with her and my family, and for her to meet my friends and spend a day with us - but that the second half of vacation (2-3 days) I just wanted to spend with my friends. \\n\\nShe did NOT like this because she thought I was \"abandoning her\" and \"making her fly alone\". She said that I clearly hadn\\'t learned from last year and that I was being selfish. \\n\\nI gave it some thought and I think she is partially right - I am being selfish in wanting to spend 2-3 days with just my friends and not considering how flying alone is scary for her. \\n\\nWhat I am hung up on is that I never get to see these friends and this is the only time I get to hang out with them. We do stuff she doesn\\'t like to do (e.g. go to breweries, go hiking, play video games) so I\\'m afraid of a 5th wheel situation too. I want to work something out with her where I can spend time with my friends but also so she doesnt feel left out or anything. She has all of her friends within a 15 minute drive of where we live in MA, but all my friends live in different states and I dont get the same option she has to spend quality \"just friends\" time wit them. I have tried to ask her how we can handle this but she is very absolute in that IF I do any part of the trip just by myself that I am wrong.', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 619176, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'top', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for wanting to spend time with only my friends on vacation?', 'updated_utc': 1554495032, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b8795w/aita_for_wanting_to_spend_time_with_only_my/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

We're extremely close and he's basically a brother. He grew up with a hard life. He had a single mother who has mental issues where she treats him horribly. She used to leave him alone so often that he joined the Bloods and was even shot at one point before he was 10 years old. Eventually he was taken away from her in his early teens and moved in with my dad's brother. He was the bad apple of the family from there on out. He used to take a lot of drugs, sell drugs, steal from houses and family, fight etc. Most of my family stopped associating with him after he was 18 because he stole from family.\\n\\nAround that age I was interested in smoking weed so we connected at some point and became pretty close doing things we're not supposed to. There were times where he went to jail and I'd help him three-way his mom or son (he was never okay with being deadbeat). He would help me out by giving me things, giving me advice, generally being supportive - it was in no way a one sided relationship. Eventually he ended up going to prison for 2 years and lost everything. Since he's gotten out we've only gotten closer and instead of an enabling type friendship - we've started encouraging each other to be better people. He talks about how he regrets how he was when he was younger all the time and that the culture shock of coming from a broken home was a big factor.\\n\\n**Summary:** While he continually fucks up - I do genuinely believe he wants to turn his life around. The issue is that he wants to turn his life around HIS way. He still has a street mentality (ex. he loves posting pictures of his money, still claims Blood and says it's impossible for him not to be, he always seems to find the crowd that's up to no good). He says he's saving to enroll in cooking school (this is true), but hustling in the meantime.\\n\\nTBH I'm pretty tired of being emotionally invested in him turning things around if he's still going to be stupid in so many ways. After his last FB posts making blatant references to illegal activity &amp; gang affiliation - I just randomly blocked him. Now he's texting me asking why he's blocked and how dare I block him without having talked about things. We've talked about it multiple times and he continues to do things that could get him in trouble. Especially when he's not completely broke anymore - At some point not getting a real job is a choice, no?\\n\\nI'm open to explaining myself, but ultimately I realize that I'm the one that has the problem with how he's doing things. We don't even see each other regularly now, but just seeing what he's up to pisses me off.

About 6 months after I came out my parents went to a conference for parents of LGBT children and after that have been going to therapy about once a month. I started going to the same therapist with them a little after a year since coming out and it has been very helpful to me. \\n\\nHowever, when me and my dad are in therapy together or have discussions I always find him domineering the conversation and not listening. I know he wants to change and is trying to fix it but after over 2 years of therapy and discussions he is more respectful  when I stop him to express how I feel, but unless I very directly interrupt him he will keep talking and when I talk he is usally focused on developing his response instead of actively listening. He is aware of this and I have called him out repeatedly.\\n\\nBackground on our personalities. \\n\\nMy dad is an entrepreneur and very authoritative and talks in statements. If you know of the emmegram test he is an Eight. He has lived in a fairly like minded and conservative Christian suburb where he and my my raised me, and when we talk he expresses that he want to have a better relationship and ability to communicate but does not want to change his other views and friends. (I do not ask him to change his views or friends but they do come up as points of contention often). I know he loves me and has been a good dad in many aspects. However he is very business oriented as a entrepreneur, most times and memories of his are interrupted by him being on a phone call or focused on money. Most discussions tend to sway towards mechanical issues at work, money, or business ideas. It is where he is comfortable talking and I resent it as I feel he has put his business and money ahead of being there for me and our family and because of that he stays I  his comfort zone and did not grow in his views or personally and let himself be surrounded in the conservative Christian bubble that was very close minded and unintentionally emotionally stunted me and hurt me. \\n\\nI am more introverted and struggled alot to come out as I am a people pleaser and always strived to do and be what was expected from me. On the emmagam scale I am a five. I recently graduated university, am working full time, and live on my own downtown. Despite being raised with negative and hurtful experiences in a conservative Christian suburb, I am still good in my faith and view it as more personal, as in not needing to go to a church. I still have alot of emotional and romantic issues due to my upbringing.\\n\\nAll that said, I find myself very resentful and irritated when me and my dad talk as whenever we work on communication or have discussions and I call him out on a behavior that stifles our conversation or something that bothers me he takes the defensive and always says it is just how he is and he doesn't know how to be different but he is trying. However he only seems to focused on our relationship if it is directly in front of him and when I vent my frustrations to my mom or sister they always remind me he is trying his best and it is hard for him to change and unintentionally invalidate my feelings. I feel that I am being unfair to my dad but I cannot get past the resentment and irritation that bubbles up I  me and I do not know if that irritation is unfounded and I am being an asshole as my parents are paying for therapy and going out of their way to actively mend our relationship and communication habits.\\n\\nTDLS My dad try's his best to better our relationship but I am still resentful that he doesn't understand me.\", 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'subreddit_subscribers': 619250, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for resenting my dad(M58) for not changing even if he is trying his best to?', 'updated_utc': 1554495258, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b87k7w/aita_for_resenting_my_dadm58_for_not_changing/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'wls': 6}\n",

Plus some kiddos running around like the one following me. So a big family that would laugh and giggle every time they looked at me and i looked at them.\\n\\nA little more background, we are all in Texas and I was wearing cowboy boots and a hat (you dont have to say it i know i look good).\\n\\nI believe they thought i was like a tourist sighting, like a giant cowboy in texas. I dont mind that at all really. Im not self conscious.\\n\\nHowever it got weird when one of the asian women approaches me and says \"You hold her on your shoulder\". While smiling and pointing at the kid.\\n\\nShe wanted me to do what the dad was doing with the other kid so the little girl could see into the gorilla pit while also getting to ride me.\\n\\nThe girl was very young and had a binkie so i thought she also had diapers and i didnt want diaper neck or someone on my head. Plus id need to take off my hat and carry it around and it was just a hassle.\\n\\nSo I say \"Oh no thanks.\"\\n\\n\"You pick her up so she can see.\\n\\n\"Oh no thanks.\"\\n\\n\"No you pick her up its ok.\"\\n\\n\"No thanks.\"\\n\\nI dont think she understands english very well so I start shaking my head from side to side and start saying \"No\" forcefully.\\n\\nThe little kid starts pouting and crying and the asian family start giving me mean looks.

We live 1h30 away from eachother. When I seemed reluctant because it was last minute.

Her youngest started acting up, shouting, crying and shoving everything in his path. I didn't mind his actions because he is 18 months old but I was pissed at my sister for not doing anything and just laughing it off even though he was disrupting other tables. I calmed him and served him his food. Some minutes later, a mom sat next to us with 3 kids, the youngest being almost the same age as my youngest nephew.  \\n\\nSo, the other kid began to throw a tantrum quite similar to the one my nephew did. Everyone was trying to stare away awkwardly except for my sister who exclaimed :\\n\\n- For f*ck sake, you don't have kids if you don't know how to raise them! Why isn't she (the mom) going away? Usually I leave when a little sh*t like this acts out!\\n\\nI was so mad and could see the desesperate mom trying to pull her child and calm him. I told my sister not to say that three times but she kept saying it louder. Every one was giving her the stink eye. I finally told her that I didn't like how she was acting and would leave if she continued. She did so I left.

I currently live over 600 miles away from my grandparents and drove out to their town when I found out he was in the hospital (under the care of one of his kids, my Uncle).  I am lucky that my job was very understanding and let me stay for the week, helping take care of my disabled Grandma and my Grandpa while under hospice in his house.  He was bedridden the entire time and we had to clean him because he was unable to do so for himself, which I know hurt his pride, but I didn't mind being there for him.  My grandparents have done so much for me and it was a no-brainer for me to be there.\\n\\nHe passed and I came back home,  because work starts again on Monday and I am unfortunately not in a position where I can keep missing work.  Not to mention the drive is costly in both gas and wear &amp; tear on my vehicle, but it was still much cheaper than a flight.\\n\\nI will be working this week and have training for my job next week in another state - my company has already paid for the flight, the hotel, etc, for a full week, and if I want to advance at this job, it's important that I go.  And I can't just keep missing work - life has to go on.\\n\\nMy Mom, who was not there during the hospice period or when Grandpa passed, wants to schedule the funeral for the week I would be traveling for work. I told her I would be unable to attend if that was the case.  I also said if they wanted to schedule it a month out instead (he will be cremated so no having to worry on the condition of the body) that I could buy a plane ticket and be there if it's on the weekend.  But I understand that these things move quick and people need closure.\\n\\nI told her that I was ok with not attending the funeral - I was there when he needed me most and I don't feel the need to be there.  She started to try and guilt me into coming. And now I'm getting it from siblings as well.\\n\\nI know everyone will wonder where I am - I'm the oldest grandchild and I was there the most.

What we usually do is that while someone is driving the other one smokes but today i got too high therefore i was not able to drive, so i told him and he was telling that i was being selfish for not letting him smoke, but then i convinced him of driving me to a place where i would feel safe and familiar so he did. When we got there i started driving to our destination(which was not far, it was less than 2-3 miles) and he started smoking. Halfway to where we were going i told him that we should stop and rest as i saw that he was really high and i was really fucking high. He then started saying that he was not high and that if i would not drive he would drive but we were both stoned. I then call my other brother and he came and got us out of there.

My childhood was difficult and I didn’t like him almost right away and I’ll admit that I’m still not his biggest fan. \\n\\nAnyway, I’ve always struggled with really bad mental health issues. Suicidal thoughts since I was 11. Horrible anxiety long before that. When he moved in with us, he brought with him a massive gun safe full of handguns and rifles. He taught us how to be safe around them and when I was younger he was very diligent about gun safety. The safe was always locked. \\n\\nI can’t remember the first time that changed. I was (and still am) into cracking safes. I went into our basement and only intended just to see if I could even hear the clicks of the dial because it was so thick but I found it unlocked. This made me really uncomfortable. The moment they showed up they’d always been a temptation, but an unreachable one. Now here they were. I wasn’t feeling horrible at that time so I shut it and locked it and asked my mother to tell him to keep it locked. \\n\\nThis happened several more times through the years. I always checked it when I was feeling okay, I had the wherewithal to do that at least, and it was always unlocked and again I asked my mom or him directly to keep it locked.\\n\\nThings got worse. I got worse. It’s never been this bad in my whole life. I’m not in an okay place right now. I spent some time in a mental health facility because all I could think about was going home in the middle of the night and getting one of his guns. Part of my discharge included a call to the two of them emphasizing how important it is to keep it locked. That was not even two weeks ago. I came back to visit and on a whim checked it. \\n\\nUnlocked.\\n\\nI can’t take it anymore. He wants me to love him and he tries to act like my father but he doesn’t even care about my safety.

She said that I need to learn to stop arguing to keep peace in the house.

Unlike my dad, she never physically hurt me. My dad was really messed up and me and my brother used to be beaten real bad. But she never did anything to help and make it easier, either. She just let it happen and even watched sometimes.\\n\\nWhen I turned 17 I decided I wanted to get away from this. My dad has changed a lot since I was younger but with him around it still isn’t a good environment. He’s still abusive, controlling, and a shitty dad/husband. My relationship with my mom still isn’t good and I know she feels guilty for everything I went through. Our relationship consisted mostly of arguing and then her ignoring me and not caring what I do. \\n\\nI started looking into getting emancipated and decided I wanted to at least move out in a few months, before I turn 18. I wasn’t sure how I would to tell my parents about it until one night when me and my mom got into another argument. I had spent a Saturday at my girlfriend’s house. \\n\\nWhen I came back my mom was crying saying, “Where were you?”, and things like that. At first I wasn’t sure why she was acting like that because I asked if I could have done this and I showed her the texts, to which she responded, “I don’t remember sending those.”\\n\\nAt this point she’s still crying and saying, “I was so scared.” And at this point I’m just thinking, Why the fuck does she *care*. So as I head upstairs I tell her, “Get used to not having me around. I’ll be gone in a few months.” My mom’s face gets so pale and she says, “Nonono please don’t say that.” And then I told her I wanted to get emancipated and then we had a discussion about it. She seemed ok with it at the time and agreed it would be best for me.\\n\\nIn the days following after I reveal this, my mom acted really out of character for her. Every time my dad would yell at me or call me an insult or something, my mom would snap, “Please don’t talk to him like that!” She started being nice and talking to me more, asking me normal parent stuff like how was school or work. \\n\\nAfter 2 days of being nice she asks me if I still want to leave her and I said I was still going to get emancipated but she has a few months before it happens. She was instantly mad, called me selfish, screamed, “You’re not fucking leaving this damn house!”, and then walked to her room and slammed the door, not coming out for the rest of the day.\\n\\nOne day I come home from school to find my mom on the kitchen floor sobbing the hardest I’ve ever seen a person cry. Her face was all red and swollen and she was flailing herself around. I’m like what the fuck and she’s repeating the words “I want to die” over and over. She sees me and says, “You can’t leave. I need you to protect me. He won’t hurt us if you’re around.” At this point she’s screaming and I don’t know what to do so I lock myself in my room after telling her if it’s such a concern she could either leave him or go to the police or something.\\n\\n\\nThe next day my mom has me sit down and talk with her. She tells me some stuff I never knew before, thinking it would make us “closer”. Like: her parents were abusive too so she understands how I feel. She met my dad in middle school and they were married at 18. He wasn’t always like this and used to treat her nice . After marrying him, my mom never had to work a day in her life. My dad’s family owned a successful business that he inherited and all that. He took good care of my mom and had a lot if money. For that reason, she wants to continue being with him so her youngest daughter can have a good life.\\n\\n\\nShe apologized for how she treated me all these years and confessed that she used to resent me and my brother because of the way we were conceived, but she promised to be a better mother if I would stay with her for a few years because she couldn’t stand losing another son. She said, “Don’t leave me like your brother did.” She was crying so much telling me this and saying she was scared.\\n\\nI feel so bad for her. Originally I was going to move out and not have contact but I don’t know about that know. It seems shitty to do that.

Whenever the topic of politics come up, heated discussions r bound to happen. When dad created the group, he asked everyone to avoid the politics topic, but it didn\\'t take long before the right-wing, anti-left and sometimes plain dictatorship apologist stuff started pouring here and there. I tried to ignored, but eventually started posting some facts to counter. \\n\\nHe messaged me privately to ask that I stop talking bout politics to avoid fights, I replied that I\\'d stop as long as everyone else did the same. He argued that their posts weren\\'t only political, but also humorous. I started posting leftist memes and comedy videos and it didn\\'t take long before my aunt complained. Discussion ensued, and I got positively surprised when Dad took my side, but the joy was short lived.\\n\\nHe asked me to stop posting any politics related content in the group, and I argued that I was posting jokes like everyone else, but he said ppl were uncomfortable and that I should either ignore the bs or leave. \\n\\nI left. Then he told me that I didn’t have to leave the group, only stop talking bout politics, and that I should just stay and ignore stuff I don’t like, that this only proves that unlike the ppl I accuse of being intolerant I can’t live with adversity and yadda yadda. \\n\\nI replied firmly that the rules should apply to everyone equally, and that he either put the foot down and tell them to stop posting things attacking the left and its politicians, either tell them to accept when I counter with my posts. \\n\\nThen today he told me that ppl want me back in the group.\\n\\nWIBTA if I refuse? \\n\\nTL,DR: My dad created a family group on what\\'sapp. His side of the family is right-wing leaning and I\\'m leftist, so he asked people to avoid the topic of politics. They ignored his request and made posts attacking the left, then complained when I started countering their posts.

My mom had me at 22 and decided she was not ready to raise a child so she left me at my grandparents when I was less than 1 and let them raise me. Throughout my upbringing she was not there and constantly missed parts of my life. The biggest one being that she used to promise to come to my birthdays, school/sports events but then never showed. She claimed me every year on her taxes but never gave the money to either myself or my grandparents.

But I guess I kinda understand, I mean that\\'s how some guys are. Then he started going on about why he was so jealous, and one of the things he brought up is that he doesn\\'t feel like his penis is big enough and I would enjoy dilators more than I would enjoy him. I was totally taken aback by this comment. He\\'s always been proud of his size, and I have too - reassuring him of this many times. But I don\\'t know, I feel like since we haven\\'t been having sex lately? maybe he\\'s getting insecure about it? We do other things that we enjoy but I guess he needs more. Anyways I was going on &amp; on about how it was just the right size, &amp; I wouldn\\'t want it to be any bigger. I already struggle with the size it is now. This is when he says, \"don\\'t take this the wrong way, but I wish another girl could see it and tell me if it\\'s big or not.\" I got really quiet and he was like. \"Seriously, don\\'t be mad I just wish other people could see it just so I can know.\" As soon as he said that, I hung up the phone. I sent him a message and said \"if you need some random girl to tell you your penis is big enough, go ahead idc\" and I felt terrible because he\\'s so supportive of what I go through, but now I feel like he might cheat on me. And it hurts because I guess my validation just isn\\'t enough for him. So I know this may seem like an obvious NTA, but I\\'m really not sure at this point. Am I just overreacting? Is it my fault because maybe I haven\\'t given him what he needs in this relationship? Idk, when he said that my self esteem just dropped down to a 1.

We returned to the car park, a large multi-storey affair and while my husband was loading up the car, I was stood next to the car with the baby in the buggy. The whole thing was less than 2 minutes and we weren’t dawdling. \\n\\nIn front of where the parking spaces are there’s a small walkway marked out for pedestrians to safely enter the shopping centre.

I shook my head at them, stared them both in the eye and gave them the middle finger because I couldn’t think of anything more inventive to be honest. \\n\\nI felt like a complete petulant child afterwards but there was more than enough space for them to get in, there were loads of other free spaces and we were already in the process of getting ready to leave when we arrived - they surely could have waited. \\n\\nAm I the asshole?   \\n\\n', 'b7ve6p': \"So my bestfriend/roomate was dating this girl that he met from our job (we both work at the same UPS hub).

She is nearing retirement age, she has no saving and she cannot drive, and we live in a rural community where work in the local area is scarce. Also important is that I have not seen her or even spoken to her in over 20 years and my fiancée has never met her. \\n\\nMy fiancée and I have been together for approximately 5 years but only moved in together about a year ago. Our house is a very small 2 bed, although the 2nd room is barely more than a box room - it's fine for the two of us, but it gets cramped if we have anyone round. Financially we are comfortable, but we are by no means well off. We're also getting married later this year and plan to start trying for a baby immediately after that. This is all important context. \\n\\nMy father is emigrating later this year, and on christmas day he took me to one side and put me on the spot; if his sister is not on her feet by the time he moves, will we take her in? I was taken aback but I did not give him an answer either way as I was not willing to commit without my fiancé's input. Shortly afterwards however, we returned to the lounge and my father phoned another member of family and, in front of my completely oblivious fiancée, informed them that we'd be happy to take in his sister. My fiancée was gobsmacked but said nothing. After we left however, she erupted and we had a major row - again, on christmas day. Because of the way she found out, she thought I was in on these plans and had agreed to all of this behind her back, and though I eventually convinced her that I was as much in the dark on this as she was, it nevertheless ruined our christmas.\\n\\nAfter calming down, we sat and talked and decided that we would not take her in. Housing her would compromise our privacy, it would potentially hamper our future plans re: trying for a baby, and  we are simply not in a position financially support a third adult right now. A few days later we went to my father's house to tell him this, however he became very angry and told us to get out. Since then, I have barely spoken to him, and on the few instances that I have, the atmosphere between us has been noticeably different. I understand the reasons for her leaving the country she was in, but I feel as though my father took it for granted that my fiancée and I, who are just starting our own lives together, would step up to the plate to support her whilst he moves to another country to start a new life for himself.

However, I don’t think it’s fair that my dad and I have to subsidize the uncle’s room share, when he and my cousin are taking up just as much of the house. It’s equivalent to my dad and I splitting a hotel as planned, then going next door and giving my uncle more money to keep things fair. Now everyone’s upset and I feel like a heel but I still think my logic is sound.

Anways, if you haven't heard T series recently passed Pewdiepie by a fairly wide margin and Pewdiepie made another diss track which has sort of revitalized interest in the whole thing. \\n\\nMy friend was talking about this today afternoon and made sort of an offensive joke towards indians as well as other asians, and that seriously irked me. I watched the new diss track and while the reception of the video has been overwhelmingly positive, I think there's a quite few problematic things with it, I think the whole video was just thinly veiled attacks against Indians and promoted anti Indian sentiments because Pewdiepie knows that it is an effective way to rally SOME (not all) of his fans to boost his subscriber numbers, it really annoyed me that he was literally trying to spread hate against a racial group purely for his self interest.  While you can and should criticize countries for violation of human rights and corruption, it was completely irrelevant to the whole sub war and at least India is trying to get solve issues like the caste system and poverty (for example, the president is a low caste member and the government has made casteism illegal for a while now and provided many policies in place to help them, open defecation is being massively curbed, people are gaining access to the internet at unprecedented rates).\\n\\nWhen I called him out on this, he said he was just joking and that he just wants a creator to be at the top instead of a company, I 100% agree with that, but I told him that pewdiepie is a terrible person and creator who has done some hideous things in the past, like making r\\\\*pe jokes back in his early youtube career, saying the n word, making anti semitic jokes to an audience he knows is predominantly young and impressionable. He called me a prick and said why are you bringing all those things up when it was in the past, and called me a sensitive little b\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*. Is he right, was I in the wrong?\", 'b7wnbs': 'My friends and I got into a huge argument yesterday over snapchat. Am I the asshole?\\n\\nTo give context:\\nMe and about 5 friends have a group chat on Snapchat. We all play video games together, mostly fortnite, and it\\'s used to talk about the game and to see if people are on and want to get on. I am definitely the best player out of all of them, everyone else plays for fun while I like competitive and tournaments. \\n\\nSo to start the argument its between me and my friend aidan. I send a text in the group chat asking Aidan is so upset that I play so much. This is what my other friend Josh said:\\n\\n\"Because u shove it in his face a game he has loved and made a big part of his life and after all his time playing you are still way better and u make it a constant reminder that he is and will never be as good as you.\" \\n\\nAnd my response is very long to this. \\n\\n\"That\\'s rediculous, I don\\'t shove it in his face, but I do when he calls me a bot, trash, sweaty, tryhard, loser and that i play too much. He is toxic so I return the favor. I posted a screenshot of my kd, it was above a 2.0. All I said was \"2 kd let\\'s go\" just felt good about it, happy about how I\\'ve grown in game in such little time. And the answers I got were you (josh) calling me a bot, and aidan calling me a bitch. No reason. Yes, I said something before that about me having 170 points and not playing with Connor because he is a bot. That was a joke, and I\\'ll explain why. I was saying that because I wasn\\'t getting on. That wasn\\'t the reason why, because he\\'s a bot, I am helping my mom plan a party. Thats why. So that clears that up. And then, aidan gets upset and tries to one up me. \"Mobile kd is 5\". So I say prove it, and he goes on to say it was an exaggeration. Okay cool. And then I bring up the case of him having 150 or so wins on mobile, and I tell him to prove that. I know it\\'s not an exaggeration because he says it many times. Last Friday, he insisted he got 10 wins in 1 night. Highly unbelievable, that\\'s good for most streamers to get in the amount of time he played. And he proceeds to get pissed and say, \"stop fucking(?) fortnite. It\\'s dog shit\" Furthering my case of aidan disliking the game. It\\'s completely his fault why I decide to try and dominate him. He is toxic and starts random fights, calling me things that are completely unnecessary. \\nI get what you\\'re saying josh. But I\\'m afraid that it is not my fault. And I\\'m afraid you\\'re on the wrong side. Aidan just gets mad at the smallest things. Like getting one pumped in fortnite, to me being happy that I did well in a tournament. Kolbie [my other friend]  sends a picture of his 11 kill triumphant win in arena and everyone gives him a pat on the back. But when I send a screenshot of my triumph in getting above a 2.0 kd, everyone shits on me for being hyped and joyful. Doesn\\'t make sense to me.\"\\n\\nAm I the asshole?

Fast forward to this last week, I was brought in for my 90 day evaluation (after working there for nearly 150 days). I was told by the regional manager that if I had one more of these I would be fired and my supervisor was sitting right next to me during this whole talk. I just said I’ll do better because of how off guard I was by This response and couldn’t summon the courage to say the person sitting next to me told me that I was doing fine and painted a whole different picture about those mistakes I made.

They've told me since they've moved in that if I needed anything for the common areas that they haven't yet unpacked or we initially didn't think we'd have room for, I was welcome to go into their room, and 'rummage' through their boxes to get it. I still feel like a shitty person for going in though, so I'm having trouble deciding how to approach the following situation.\\n\\nBefore they moved in, I was already aware that their cleanliness isn't all that great. So I made a point to make sure we had an understanding that I don't care what they do behind closed doors in their room and bathroom, as long as they respect the common areas and to keep in mind that my apartment has been known as a cozy spot for spiders Long with a cockroach or two (gross, I know), especially during warmer weather. Because of this I've always been super anal about making sure my place is clean, as in no food or dirty dishes lying around,  no clothes on the floors, nothing that could potentially make these asshole critters think I'm running a buggy-brothel. Basically I told them, obviously it's your room, your bathroom, do what you want, but be mindful about the basics.\\n\\nIt's been about three months now. Their door is always closed and we're on completley opposite sleep and work schedules, so aside from the weekends, it's rare that we even cross paths. Noticed a week ago that the central air didn't seem to be cooling. I had this problem last summer, so I told my friend that if it got too warm or stuffy, just open their window and let me know that way I'm not trying to force the air unit to overwork with windows open. They insisted they were fine, but okay. Air seemed to be okay for a few days until it this week, I noticed it again. Except this time the register was reading under 60 even though my bedroom and the living room felt like a sauna. Asked them if they had the window open, and if they noticed the warmth at all. They said no, they were fine. Figured I'd just put in a maintenance ticket tomorrow morning and have them look at. Brushed it off, turned the unit off and opened all the windows knowing I went through this with them last year.\\n\\n*For clarity, our bedrooms face the back of the building. I always park in the front lot, so I wouldn't have noticed their room, and I have no reason not to take friend's word for it especially considering they had a similar with their apartment. Anyone familiar with central air should undwrstand why you don't leave doors and windows open while trying to force air throughout the apartment. Rentals have cheap units to begin with, it's only a matter of time before you break it, and have to deal with a ridiculously high electric bill.*\\n\\nCue today: ran out to do some errands, came back and randomly decided to park in the back lot. I have to walk past our rooms to get to my door this way. Noticed that their bedroom window was open when I've been running the air all day. They aren't home and won't be until early in AM so I took it upon myself to go in and close their window, figuring that I could turn the unit off, let it recalibrate and see if I could get it working again before resorting to maintenance. First thing I noticed was how filthy their room is. By filthy I literally mean filthy. Nevermind that I couldn't see a single inch of carpet because of all their clothes, papers, and turned out boxes. We're talking a couple dozen open (presumably empty) soda cans, an open plate with a pizza slice from a few weeks ago (identifiable as the one we got a few weeks ago b/c of the toppings), a couple forks jammed into the carpet, a few cups, plates and plastic containers with leftover dinners from the course of the past few weeks, *personal* used items, etc... I also saved a pretty giant spider that was resting on a sock while trying to make my way across the room to the damn window.\\n\\nI'm absolutely livid because it feels like even though we've been good friends for 15 years, they're completely disrespecting my home (their room used to be my home office and gym, which is space I've had for 4 years now that I decided to sacrifice for them) and the help I've extended by giving them a place to stay, even though if it weren't for poor money habits, they wouldn't need it (off-lease, meaning I'm also putting myself at risk of landlord drama), until they get back on their feet.\\n\\nObviously, I can't have the apartment in that condition because I've learned that even when everything is spotless, my building tends to have serious insect problems in the summer. On the same token, I went into their room without asking, without them knowing which is how I found out about it. I'm conflicted because I know it's shitty for anyone to invade personal space, friend or not. If I don't wait up until 5am to confront them, we won't cross paths again for weeks because of our work/sleep schedules and I'm about to go out of town in a few days.

More like friendly acquaintances, esp since they moved out of state, specifically to the state where our DeadBeat Dad lives. Sibling has a good relationship with DeadBeat. I have no relationship whatsoever with DeadBeat, due to the fact that he physically abused me when I was a toddler.\\n\\nMom had left him when pregnant with me, then took him back when I was about two or three years old. He was only with us for a year or so, but he beat and derided me pretty consistently throughout, as well as and verbally abusing our Mom and stealing from us/Mom's friends/our neighbors to support his crack cocaine habit.\\n\\nBecause he abused and traumatized me during early childhood development, I now suffer from clinical major depression &amp; generalized anxiety disorder, with regular anxiety- and panic-attacks. I've developed coping strategies, but a large part of me blames my suffering on DeadBeat. I still have vivid dreams and memories about the times he beat me every once in awhile.\\n\\nSo, Sibling doesn't remember this as they were a fetus/infant at the time. DeadBeat was imprisoned for theft and drugs basically right after they were born. They didn't have contact with him until they were already an adult. They grew up without ever knowing him &amp; always had a very romanticized view of what having him in our lives would be like. So when he offered them financial help for their newborn and a place to stay, they jumped at it. Understandable, I guess.\\n\\nISSUE: Sibling's 2nd wedding is coming up. DeadBeat will be there. I thought I was going to be able to handle being near him, esp. as Sibling assures me I don't even have to speak to him or his current wife. However, in these past months leading up to this wedding, my panic attacks &amp; overall anxiety have gotten much more frequent, and I've been struggling more with depressive episodes than I have in recent years. The only major change in my life has been this upcoming wedding. I think it's getting to me more than I initially thought it would. Not to mention that it's out of state, and I'm not in the best financial shape, so there's that added stress.  I also have student loans/debt &amp; I work a non-salaried/non-hourly job - can't really even afford to be going to this one, but I am. None of this is Sibling's fault, and I haven't told them at all.\\n\\nI'm going to the wedding. I love Sibling and I want to be part of my niblings' lives. But a few weeks after the event, I plan to tell Sibling that this was a one-time-deal.

We all vibed off each other really well and just generally had a fun time together. Jenny, however, began to do things that bugged me. She'd be very passive aggressive, straight up ignore you if she was upset sometimes, and be manipulative. She could also often be emotionally draining to be around. While I am willing to support a friend in need, when it was just me and her alone, she'd turn the conversation to her personal problems nearly every time we spoke.

For the most part, it was a decent time. But I found that she kept doing more and more things that irked me. Eventually, I realized I was going to my other friends complaining about the things she'd do, and that's when two things hit me: A) that I sort of dislike Jenny, and B) that that's a pretty shitty, asshole-ish thing to do. Friends shouldn't be complaining about you behind your back, and friends don't act like they like you to your face when in reality they sort of dislike you. Jenny and I aren't very close anyway, and we don't text on the daily or anything. In fact, we rarely text or talk outside of hanging out with Bruce at all. I think if I were to ghost her, she probably wouldn't notice too much. I should also clarify that by ghosting, I wouldn't lose her number or anything. I would still respond to a text if she sent one, but I wouldn't be initiating any conversations, and I certainly won't be hanging out with her again. Also, if she were to ask if we were still friends or why I'm not really around anymore, I'd give her an honest answer. I just want to make sure that this approach of, just kind of... not initiating anything... makes me a dick or if I should confront her straight-up and be honest now.\\n\\nTL;DR: Became friends with this girl, realized I sort of dislike her and decided I don't want to be her friend anymore.

He had been with his ex for 5 years whereas my relationship was about a year long and we were mainly FWB. She ended up cheating on him and they have an extremely toxic relationship, because she still passively aggressively posts about him on social media sometimes.

We hugged it out and went separate ways, and we don’t really talk anymore. \\n\\nSometimes my ex will send me a song from a band from a very specific genre that we both love over Snapchat. This happens about once every 3 months or so (relevant I promise). \\n\\nRecently my boyfriend and I adopted an “open phone policy”. He was the one who wanted it and I didn’t really care either way. Basically, he said the idea was so we could quickly look something up if necessary. \\n\\nI came out of the shower and my boyfriend was reading through my saved snapchat conversations with my ex. Immediately I felt violated. He then turned to me and asked me why I was flirting with him. Just for context, this conversation with my ex happened a month ago and I haven’t seen my ex since we broke up. The conversation went like this: \\n\\nEx: Hey, here’s the new song [band name] just released! Pretty rad. Tell me what you think. I just listened to it after I ate some brownies and it was awesome. \\n\\nMe: (hours later) Very cool! They are awesome. Save some for me, haha.

The thing that was bothering me though was she had gotten a kindle for Christmas and was going into chat sites.

His friend convinced him to smoke weed, and then he just had to try alcohol too. I was like \"okay, don\\'t like this, but so long as he accommodates me, we\\'re good\". For awhile, I\\'ll admit I went too hard and wouldn\\'t let him even MENTION the stuff. By this point, I am chill with the mention of it. But now, he\\'ll try and get me to consider like, being around it, “to get over it\" sometimes, but does drop it when I say no. I know it\\'s a big part of his life, and where he met a lot of friends, but I just can\\'t even consider it. Like, when we went to his family\\'s Thanksgiving, EVERYONE was drinking heavily. And I was sitting on the edge of a panic attack the entire evening, unable to have fun. When he asked if he could have one drink, I felt like vomiting, and asked if he wouldn\\'t. Alcohol is a smaller trigger than smoke, so if I couldn\\'t handle that I couldn\\'t handle anything else.\\n\\nI know he just wants me to be involved in all parts of his life, and not being okay with this means I can\\'t meet all of his friends, but my trauma is so fresh because my sister is STIll suffering from the repercussions of substance abuse now, and I can\\'t do anything to help her. I have not made any attempt to try and stop him, because I know it is not my place. My boyfriend does everything responsibly and safely, so I trust him, but I\\'m not at a point in my life in which I can handle it. I love him, and we have almost no issues beyond this. He is not the bad guy here IMO, but my stance is that I\\'m not either.\\n\\n**TDLR; I can\\'t be around alcohol or any sort of drug that is smoked due to trauma that is still fresh, but my boyfriend who does those things wants me to be fully involved in his life.

I\\'ve worked there for a few years now.\\n\\nI\\'ve been reported and shit-talked countless times because of my reputation as the jerkass service tech.

I\\'ve been written up more than a few times. This property that I work at has also seen quite a few property damage incidents and personal injury incidents due to both customer and employee carelessness.\\n\\nI almost blew up on a customer because they were smoking in their vehicle with their propane bottles open one time, and calmly but firmly explained that propane is explosive and that the customer could\\'ve gotten killed and injured or killed other people while on the property. Even reported it to my manager that the guy was doing that. But I got written up because I was \"rude.\" I never cursed and I never berated the customer, but because I deemed that a life-threatening situation I spoke with command. In my experience, people who already give no cares don\\'t actually listen to \"nice.\" I\\'ve tried it too many times before only to be ignored, so I dropped the sunshine and rainbows act entirely. \\n\\n\\nAnd it seems like the customers *do* listen to commands a lot more than they do when I treat them like royalty. \\n\\nOther examples include:  \\n\\n1 - directing people on where they can park/stand when things get busy and big company vehicles need to move around the property through command instead of request (I don\\'t care who has insurance and who\\'s liable, ***any*** collateral damage is a major pain in the ass to deal with)\\n\\n2 -  commanding people to leave designated \"employees only\" zones (OSHA violations galore if I don\\'t, and it\\'s not like any of the other employees on the property actually care to enforce any of the company rules) \\n\\n3 - firmly suggest that people keep the backs of their trucks/vans clear for equipment so that nobody gets hurt trying to load up equipment on an uneven pile of junk.\\n\\n4 - always (firmly and concisely) direct any customer who wanders into my workspace to go ask their questions to the people working in the office because they\\'re far more qualified to answer any equipment use-related questions than I am. I\\'m a service tech, so I work outside and perform maintenance on any machine scheduled for maintenance. I\\'ve never personally used any of the equipment. I\\'ve no experience in landscaping, carpentry, or anything like that - all I know is hardware and how to maintain it, so they\\'re trying to get blood from a stone regardless. \\n\\n5 - never humoring a customer with a propane refill on an expired bottle no matter how much they beg, because I\\'ll always be liable if something *does* happen during or after I fill the expired bottle \\n\\n\\nOne may think that these situations are rare, but they\\'re not, even with every effort to not be around customers.

I\\'m also not nice. I don\\'t make requests, I issue orders, and that\\'s because due to past experiences I want to leave as little room for error and incident as possible.

', 'b7xzu9': 'I  am a night-shift employee at a fairly small gas station and convenience  store in a VERY small town (Less than 500 people small.) This gas station usually plays host to a group of older men in the mornings who like to come play cribbage and drink coffee that the management gives them for free.\\n\\nOne  particular man, who for the rest of the post will be referred to as M,  has never worked for our location, nor any other location in our chain. However, He constantly speaks to myself and the other younger  members of our staff as though he is our supervisor. When he isn\\'t doing  this, he is simply making rude or snide comments about us either  directly to us or to the others in his group.\\n\\nSimply put, M comes in every day, and after he\\'s done with cribbage, fills our coolers if something is low. He has to go back into what would normally be employee only areas to do this most of the time, and is very nasty to the rest of the staff about it.\\n\\nWith  all the context out of the way, I go in to work one day to find that the general manager had  to come in to cover the morning shift.  We switch tills, and while the GM is  going back to take midday count of her till and our slot machine payout  funds, M comes up to me and tells me, word for word, \"Now I went around  and filled up all those coolers, and they\\'d BETTER look like that when I  come in in the morning.\"\\n\\nFrustrated, I  go to the GM and essentially  said that I\\'m sick of M speaking to me like he\\'s my boss, and that he  shouldn\\'t really be doing anything that he does around here in the first  place, even if it can be helpful sometimes. My boss, likely frustrated  already considering she shouldn\\'t have had to be there that day, told me  that she was thrust into that shift, and that they were swamped in the  morning, so he was just helping her out. I told him what he had said to  me and she told me, quote, \"It\\'s not always about you. And sometimes  people on the night shift, not you, but people on the night shift leave  the coolers empty. Ron\\'s just being helpful so you\\'ll just have to learn  to ignore him.\" I decided not to press further after that, frustrated.\\n\\nWithin this statement,  there\\'s the implication that I, as practically the only night shift  worker we have, do not fill the coolers properly at night. I fill the  coolers to the point where they look full every night before I leave,  but if there are three or more bottle in a row, or the cans/bottles are  large and bulky like Arizona tea cans or tall 38 oz cans, I typically  leave them. I also don\\'t fill the rows completely, because as stated  above, pushing the bottles/cans all the way to the back results in them  falling behind the shelves entirely, or makes the more top heavy bottles  fall over and out of the coolers when they\\'re meant to slide down.\\n\\nSo  Long Story short, I think M should be asked not to return to the store.

We had been together for 10 years and she walked out of our home the night she admitted her affair to me and left. This blindsided me so it's been pretty rough for me to accept, I was hoping she would at least try some marriage counselling or try and figure out what went wrong before I made a decision on if we should part ways but she wasn't interested and basically told me in no uncertain terms we would never get back together and to give up any hope of that. She is still with this guy today.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo around this time last year, before the cheating was revealed, 2 of our closer friends invited us to their wedding, my wife is best friends with the Bride I was invited to be a Groomsman by the Groom and happily accepted. When we first broke up, I was talking to the Groom and pointed out that the wedding was going to be an issue, in my experience the bridal party are introduced to a song (we had picked our wedding song), dance together etc. He agreed and said he would actually understand if I couldn't go, but that I should definitely go to his bucks–a week long overseas trip. In January the Bride had her birthday and didn't invite me or mention anything, which kind of hurt. I put that aside and went to the bucks recently, had a good time with the buck.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOn the weekend it was time to RSVP for the wedding and I'd been changing my mind back and forth often and thought maybe it was best if I avoided it all-together. The few times I've seen my ex when she has come to our house to pack her things, take the dog etc, I've found it really difficult to be around her so I've been avoiding any contact and removed her from social media to try and focus on moving on. I tried to call the groom to ask if my ex would be bringing her affair partner and to see what expectations there are for the bridal party. He didn't answer his phone so I sent a message basically saying that I regrettably won't be attending because of the situation with my ex-wife. In hindsight I probably should have kept trying to call him but I was really anxious about the call in the first place and just wanted it to be dealt with so I could try and relax. I haven't got a reply from him in 24 hours and I've tried to ring him several times today but he isn't answering, which is a bit unusual for him. I just wanted to say that maybe I panicked a bit sending the text message off and perhaps I could go to the ceremony as a regular non bridal party member and that would make things a bit more bearable for me in terms of being around my ex-wife.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI just feel awful about it, I thought he would understand but maybe after all this time he forgot that he said he would understand if I didn't come, or figured I would've said something sooner.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAITA here or am I overthinking this?

She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere.

I ask her if she is aware that we grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

My brother is autistic, and the conspiracy theory that vaccinations cause autism hurts him deeply (undeniably disproven, as I’m sure I don’t have to say to fellow Redditors). It hurts me, too — he’s my brother, and I feel like society has failed him and people like him by allowing this anti-vax mindfuck to take hold. When the opportunity presents itself, I’ll never stop trying to convince others that A) vaccines do NOT cause autism; and B) the argument that autism is worse than polio/smallpox/other disfiguring or fatal diseases is pretty fucked up anyway.\\n\\nMy boyfriend’s parents know this very well. They know my brother, having lived in the same small town, and they know my stance. We’re all usually very careful to avoid the topic, as we know that it wouldn’t generate critical discussion or change anyone’s mind.\\n\\nThat said, though, something was different tonight.

They’ve known in the past to skirt the subject around me for the reasons mentioned above. I was pissed. By this point, my boyfriend’s dad and sibling had quieted and were drinking beer, clearly signalling that they were ready to talk about other things, but I couldn’t just let them say this asinine shit unchallenged. So I took it to the next level. I wanted to argue — I can’t honestly say I thought I could truly change their minds.

NZ and holiday is on the 19th of April.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAt the beginning of last week my mum decided she would have a holiday with all her friends, her dog (and theirs who I happen to despise), and my brother who I don't hate but he can be a real pain in the ass especially on trips. Now this is all fine, you know, I don't care if she goes to space for a damn week. The one issue I'm having is that she wants me to come. I don't want to for various reasons but basically I dislike her friends and I don't like the location or how it this holiday may affect me and my school results (I'm in the top class at my school so I take my work kinda seriously). She says I must come because I'm a minor and she's my mother and that she cares for me so much that she has to take me.  I told her by disregarding my feelings and my freedom she clearly does not love me and I refused to go. She hasn't responded to any of my texts since I have expressed how I feel and sternly (but politely or at least a basic sense of courtesy) rejected her offer. AITA? How should I proceed?\", 'b7zi6o': 'So, Xmas of 2017 my brother in law and I got into a huge fight. He has always been kind of a dick to me but this specific time was my tipping point. We were all drinking, having fun. HE brings up race/white privilege and I welcome the discussion because as a grad student in cultural studies, I study/talk about this shit all the time. Fine. He fancies himself the “devils advocate” in any and all situations. Things get intense and just in time, a friend shows up and he has to get up to grab the door. As he does so, he makes some drunken comment to his friend about me along the lines of “She always says stupid shit and pretends to know what she’s saying” when asked about why we were shouting as they approached the door. This does it for me and I tell him to fuck off, and I go to the guest room to cool off. \\n\\nI overhear him talking shit about me to his friend, talking about how “he didn’t even try that hard and my whole snowflake worldview came crashing down.” “He has to handle me with baby gloves,” etc. literally nobody else agrees with him, and I come out and mention that I don’t care about the discussion about race because I have them all the time...but I don’t appreciate being belittled. This makes him laugh and continue to be a dick, so I go back to the guest room and that was that. \\n\\nNow my question is not necessarily about him; most people agree that he’s an asshole...I am mainly concerned with my sister, who is frustrated because I’ve actively avoided him since this event. I understand that she doesn’t want to pick sides between her husband and her sister, and she is the type of person who just wants harmony with everyone. But her husband adds nothing to my life but frustration and I don’t feel like I owe her any more attempts to hang out with them both (this is not the first time he’s been rude to me/we’ve gotten in a big fight). \\n\\nSo, two weeks ago we happened to be in Virginia at the same time randomly (we live in separate states.) she suggested they drive to where my partner and I were on a Sunday because her husband had the day off (he was there for work). I told her the truth, which was that my partner and I wanted alone time. She ended up coming on Monday alone, and she confronted me about why I have been avoiding her husband. When I told her I had no interest in being associated with him she got really upset, and I told her I’d try one more time to hang out with him. But I REALLY want to take that back now because just the thought of interacting with him again gives me anxiety. She wants to bring him to my graduation in May and I don’t want him there. \\nAITA if I go back on my word?\\n\\nThanks in advance. \\n\\n', 'b7zj1p': 'Background: My brother applied for membership to MENSA about two years ago and was accepted. No big surprise to anyone, he\\'s always been incredibly smart and has always tested well above normal. However, he isn\\'t the most humble of folks and is the type of person who brings it up literally whenever he can, or as a reason to end an argument (eg \"Which of us is the MENSA member here?\"). I don\\'t really have any other experience with MENSA members so I don\\'t know if this is normal for them. But after a year, I was at my wit\\'s end, so I decided I would try my hand at getting in too, to see if it would shut him up. I\\'m not as smart as him, but I studied how to take the Miller Analogies Test and took a bunch of practice tests, and on my second try taking the real thing, I wound up with a score high enough to be accepted to MENSA.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt seems to have worked on the shut-the-fuck-up front for my brother, and I was pretty satisfied and thought I would leave it at that. However, I\\'ve been dusting up my resume recently and was going through the certifications/qualifications section. I know that a lot of people think membership in high-IQ societies is elitist and arrogant, but obviously I want to present myself in the best light to any future employers. My girlfriend thinks it would be an asshole move to put it on there, like I would essentially be saying \"I am the top post on r/iamverysmart.\" I\\'m inclined to agree with her, just because my interaction with my brother has left me with a bad impression.

We were 16 at the time while he was 35 when they started and went on sporadically for about a year. He talked about getting me and my friend ‘wankered’ and more. we were discussing how young we were and had no idea how creepy all the kinds of stuff he was saying to us was and discussing if this was ok. I don’t know how loud it was to others but we weren’t whispering I’d say like normal conversation tone which may be weird for a busy train but at this point there’s like one person every 10 empty seats and no one is opposite us. Then this guy from a table next to us speaks up and says ‘I don’t think that’s a very appropriate conversation to be having on a train’. We were so embarrassed as he called us out loudly and me and my friend DONT do confrontation. We were shocked because he had headphones in and made a point of disdainfully removing them to y’all to us. honestly we were quite unaware of anyone else around us being uncomfortable. \\n\\nWe get he could have been triggered but also we feel like it was an asshole thing and we’d like opinions (please be gentle we mean no harm and just want to know if we fucked up)\\n\\nAre we the assholes for having this conversation on a train or was it weird for this guy to butt in?

I've never had any real association with her and wouldn't have talked to her once if it wasn't for the fact that I catch the ferry with her. I'm generally pretty polite to her and just talk about small talk and usually, we just have conversations with the other people I sit with on the ferry (Liv and Coco). \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI always like to avoid disliking people, it takes up to much time and effort and doesn't get anyone anywhere, but Lexi has a special place in my heart. When I first met Lexi I had no issues with her at all but soon she'd barely ever acknowledge me in conversations. Either way, no biggie. Then there was 'the ferry order'. Lexi really didn't want me to sit next to her so she silently made a seating arrangement. Even though Coco gets on after me, Lexi is always sitting next to Liv and Coco and away from me. Again I just put up with it. That was until one day I just sat where I wanted. I guess that one day was too hard for Lexi so she decided from then on we'd all stand up she wouldn't sit next to me. It was soon I found out that she talked sooo much shit about me behind my back, about just how much she hated me. For what I'll never know. For asking her how her weekend was? She continued to ignore me and chat shit for however long as well as some new mean comments among other things.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis is when the perfect opportunity for payback comes around.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOne day we're on the ferry and I'm talking about the people I'm doing a play with (I go to a girls school and this is a thing with the brother school). I'm talking about the play when I mention a dude, Knox, who is really popular. He's a nice dude. At the mention of his name, she says eww. So later that day at rehearsals I asked Knox if he knows Lexi and he says he's never heard of her. He asks me why I'm asking and I explain so he looks up her insta. We kinda joke around and he's like '800 followers and she only follows 300 back! Wow, that's real low. One post! Pfft. And it's captioned tomato twins, what does that even mean?' So he asks me if I like her and I explain and he says let's just have a chat with Lexi. He just sent hi. She responds with hi and leaves her on read for a week. Turns out that week she's been proudly telling everyone that she thinks Knox likes her so she seems popular. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAt first I wanted to embarrass her in front of everyone she told, but then I thought I would just tell her on the ferry but some of my friends say this would be too mean. Liv and Coco say it would ruin her if I tell her because it's coming from me, the person she thinks so low of, and say I should do it. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR; Some girl acts like a bitch to me unprovoked and now's my chance for payback but I don't know if I'll be like her.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWIBTA if I told her about what happened instead of just leaving it, even if it's on the ferry with just Coco and Liv?\", 'b7zxmh': \"Don't need a throwaway as my family doesn't know what reddit is.\\n\\nSo, to give some background, I'll explain some things that happened in the past.

The guy who checked in just before 2 talked about leaving at 5 for work, so when I got a phone call at 5 from a guest who wanted their money back, I assumed it was him.\\n\\nThis guy said he had checked in just before 2, he was unhappy with the room, he said the TV didn\\'t work, the bed and pillows were super uncomfortable, and the fridge was loud and he hadn\\'t managed to get any sleep. I told him the only way I could do a refund was if he checked out right away, and he agreed.\\n\\nI had been away from the desk and when I got back I saw the name on the caller ID was not in fact the guest I had checked in but a different one. Someone who had checked in at 10:30. I considered honoring the refund to save face, but at the same time, 6 hours in a room where you\\'re apparently miserable is a bit much.\\n\\nI explained the misunderstanding to the man, who did not take it well. Apparently I had misheard the time he told me he had arrived, and he in turn had been mistaken about the time. Still, I told him that because of how long he had been at the hotel, and had not previously reported the issues (that I could have easily fixed by moving him to another room) I could only offer a small discount.\\n\\nHe didn\\'t like this answer, saying that how was he supposed to know that was all he had to do, and how was he supposed to know a new room wouldn\\'t be worse or the same?

So I carefully take out their clothes and place them on a counter in the middle of the room to make room for my clothes.\\n\\nI didn\\'t think much of this, but apparently I may have broken some unspoken rule of laundry etiquette. One time I did this, I got a note in my laundry saying that I should have just waited because I \"moved someone\\'s laundry out not even 10 minutes after their load was done.\"\\n\\nMaybe they didn\\'t like that I had my greasy hands all over their clothes? That I could have accidentally dropped a sock of theirs and lost it?\\n\\nBut my thought is that if you\\'re in a shared laundry room, it\\'s your responsibility to take your clothes out promptly. It tells you how long it takes: 30-35 minutes for the washer and 40-45 minutes for the dryer. You can set a timer.

The clothes were still there. I had given them a grace period, so I took their clothes out and put them to the side. I continued on with my day and switched my laundry to the dryer after it was done washing. Then when I came back to pick up my dry clothes, I realized that this other person took my clothes out of the dryer, probably pretty close to when I put them in because they were still completely wet, and used my wash cycle, which I paid for, to dry their clothes. There was an empty dryer right next to mine, so this was clearly an intentional act of revenge. I had to pay another $1.50 to redo the load that they stole and also waste 45 minutes of my time. I had to get up early the next day for a class I have, and these were my bedsheets, so this person cost me 45 minutes of sleep.

My mother was getting paranoid that my father was cheating on her. He honestly never had time for \"another family\" nor did he even have time for all the stress my mother was putting him under.  Finally it came to a point here she was screaming at him over her missing tupperware and asked for a divorce that night. My dad was tired of all the yelling and fighting over the past two years so he just agreed - which seemed to surprise my mother. The following months ensued and my mother spoke to anyone that would lend an ear that she was going to milk my dad for all his money and make his life a living hell - which she had also told me several times so I decided to record her. She would tell me stories that my dad would beat me and that I just don\\'t remember because I\\'m trying to suck up to my dad. Which was ironic because my mother was the one who would assault and belittle me all my life (even going as far as to scream and hit me while we were having dinner in public). Let\\'s just say my dad was none too happy when I played the recording for him. Things seemed to die down from there and my parents were going back and forth through court for hearings.

I informed my father of this and he responded in a generally positive tone, saying he understood where I was coming from and hoped we could work on things in the future.\\n\\nThen, my GM sent me a long email about how upsetting it was for *her* to hear that I had not invited my dad, that *she* would find it heart-wrenching to attend a wedding where the bride\\'s father was not present, and so, in protest of my decision, she was declining to attend the wedding.

I also have a lot of family in Texas and visit them/stay with them too. Growing up I didnt have much and didnt travel so it\\'s very important to me. I\\'ve done this every spring since 2016 and it is the only time I get to spend with my friends since we all live in different parts of the country (they\\'re still my best/closest friends despite me having some friends where I live). I also cherish time with my family (my cousin and husband and their kids, my aunts).\\n\\nThe first year of me and my gf dating (2017), her family had already planned a trip to NH and me to Texas. It was only q week and we had no real problems there. The second year (last year) I had talked to her about her coming with me for one week to stay with family and then the second week I would stay with just friends. She did not like this and thought i wasn\\'t considering her when making plans to go. \\n\\nAfter a lot of consideration and talking through it, she was mostly right. I wasn\\'t actively avoiding having her come but I wasn\\'t trying as hard as I should to include her on my trip and consider her thoughts and feelings. We talked it out and I apologized. I recognize that I should have involved her earlier in the process and asked what she thought about the trip before taking the time off of work and planning with my friends/family.\\n\\nBecause it was too late and she couldn\\'t get the time off, and since I already had booked the flights/time off and my friends and family were expecting me, I ended up going on the two week trip myself. Usually it is only one so this was a lot of time. I still had fun but i realized how I had been wrong and wanted to include my girlfriend on my next trip to Texas. \\n\\nThis year in January I brought up doing the trip. I made it a point to ask her what she thought, what she wanted, her thoughts on flying - she doesnt care to travel much and gets anxious about meeting new people/my family so she seemed reserved. I told her that my idea was to go for a week and spend the first half of the vacation with her and my family, and for her to meet my friends and spend a day with us - but that the second half of vacation I just wanted to spend with my friends. She did NOT like this because she thought I was \"abandoning her\" and \"making her fly home alone\". She said that I clearly hadn\\'t learned from last year and that I was being selfish. \\n\\nI gave it some thought and I think she is partially right - I am being selfish in wanting to spend 2-3 days with just my friends and not considering how she hasnt flown in a long time and that is  scary for her. \\n\\nWhat I am hung up on is that I never get to see these friends (my closest friends) and this is the only time I get to hang out with them and do stuff that we like to do, which she frankly doesn\\'t like to do (e.g. go to breweries, go hiking, play video games). I want to work something out with her where I can spend this time with my friends but she doesnt feel like I am abandoning her or making her feel left out. She has all of her friends living within a 15 minute drive of where we live in Massachusetts because we moved to her home town, but all my friends live in different states and I dont get the same option she has to spend quality \"just friends\" time with just them.

Since my boyfriends work was well paid of, he told me to take my time and find a job that I would like. Unfortunately, in middle of march he was let go, and our situation became pretty bad, as we didn’t really have any money then and hoped for April to be better thanks to his salary.

I supported the idea, thinking that we’ll be on a better footing when the time came. Well, the time came and we’re currently living on money borrowed from my parents, and today he tells me he’s going to buy a ticket. I pointed out to him that the ticket for a concert, along with train tickets will take a good quarter of what we will receive this month, and told him not to whine at the end of the month that we have no money(he tends to get very angry about it).

Thirty minutes before the set time she texts my boyfriend saying the other people had cancelled (my boyfriend and I live a 45 minute drive from her place), but she had still ordered pizza and he should come over.  \\nHe still decided to go over because he does not feel like she is looking for anything more than friendship. \\nNothing did happen, but I’m upset because I feel as if she had manipulated the situation to get him alone, and he crossed a line by willfully going.\\n\\nAITA for asking him to limit his contact with her?', 'b82mo6': \"My gf and I were discussing this and its something I think about a lot.

I didn\\'t want this guy in the same building as wife. I didn\\'t care if it was different departments. So I knew he had to go. I told him that my wife and I had an open relationship, and that she actually reciprocated his attraction towards her. I then said that I was telling him this because she was very shy, and would never make a move. However, I said that she was definitely into him, and that if he tried something it would make her so happy and she\\'d probably fall into his arms. \\n\\n\\n\\nNow the thing is, we don\\'t have an open relationship, and she isn\\'t into him.

She then started seeing me. I did tell her I broke up with my girlfriend over a month ago because the first time we met she mentioned that she doesnt get involved with people who just broke up with thier SOs.\\n\\nWe only spent breaks together but she was home for 2 months due to and internship and getting time off school. So we saw eachother alot. When she was gone we texted and I said I missed you a couple times. We definantly texted alot and I called her when things where going bad for her at college. Everytime she was gone we would text everyday, tell eachother I miss you and talked about how excited we where to see eachother. I knew she was seeing other people, she even texted them when we hung out She apparently had an std scare when a partners condom broke, and she called me right away. One time I knew she had sex with another person that day and came over 8 hours later.\\n\\nA couple weeks ago D suddenly texted me asking were we where going and that we have been kinda acting like more then fwbs? D then told me that if I wasnt going to date her eventually then she didnt want to be involved much longer. I told D that my depression was bad so I cant really make that decision. I thanked her for coming over and helping me multiple times and picking me up from work. She then told me that she\\'ll keep seeing me but if Im not going to commit then she is going to keep seeing other people. D tells me to tell her if im not interested anymore or are seeing other people.\\n\\nD\\'s spring break comes along and we text how excited we are to meet again, but after the first day. I dont want to see her. My anxiety acts up so I just stop opening her snaps. D contacts me on facebook saying \"Why are you ghosting me? Youre active on snapchat but not opening my messages? I thought you wanted to see me over break?\" So I tell her I never wanted to be with her and that Im too depressed to think about being in a relationship and that her pushing made me uncomfortable. Then I blocked her. She saw my post with my new girlfriend 4 days after we talked. She sent me messages calling me a liar, and saying I never respected her. I told her that she was gross for sleeping with someone else the same day she came to see me and that she cant be mad I dont have feelings for her. She responded by calling me a coward that lead her on and slut shamed her.

Yesterday was my girlfriend\\'s birthday, and the past couple of days have been pretty bad to put it lightly. The day prior I took her out to eat, took her shopping, and then took her to her favorite little park that has a waterfall. I was trying my best to keep it together, but pain like this is going to show no matter what. I apparently frustrated her because I complained quite a few times about how much pain I was in and with the pace I had to walk (part of the pain right now is in my leg and I have to limp around so I walk pretty slowly). That night I went to bed pretty early as my disease causes me fatigue (and we did quite a bit that day) and that is the only way for me to escape the pain besides drowning myself in painkillers and the like.\\n\\nThe morning of her birthday I slept in again for the same reason, and I know this upset her very much. I didn\\'t wake up until around noon, which meant half of her birthday was already over :(. When I woke up I gave her her gifts (everything she told me she wanted: a new ring, shoes, some makeup and a bouquet of flowers). After that, it took me quite a while to get ready and we didn\\'t end up leaving the apartment until around 2:30 to head to her family\\'s house (when she originally told me she wanted to leave around noon). At her family\\'s house I didn\\'t really talk much and didn\\'t participate in all of the things they were doing because of my pain. \\n\\nAfter all of this we had to head to her grandmother\\'s house as she was leaving for a trip and she wanted us to take care of her dog and watch over the house. While packing my stuff I admittedly snapped on her a little bit as I felt like I was reaching my limit and was having to carry around a couple of pretty heavy things which increased my pain even more. \\n\\nThis morning she told me that I \"ruined\" her 21st birthday and she feels like I don\\'t care about her. She texted me \"one day...my fucking birthday...that\\'s all I wanted.\"\\n\\nNow in addition to the pain I feel fucking awful. It hurt so bad to hear that I \"ruined\" her 21st birthday and I kind of fell silent after that because I didn\\'t know what to say which just made her more upset with me.\\n\\nSomeone please give me their opinion on what is going on here.

AITA for what happened??', 'b83r4q': '[removed]', 'b83rac': 'Howdy y\\'all, and sorry if this falls under the \"general relationship AITA post\", I understand if it does and gets removed. However, I\\'ve been pondering this situation for around 4 years now and wonder if I was the asshole. Preamble aside, lets lay out the situation.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI was 18 and working at HEB when I found my first (and currently only) GF. She was another employee that I met in the break-room, and she caught my attention due to being interested in many of the things that I was interested, such as games, science, and fantasy. While I didn\\'t find her attractive due to her weight (I\\'m from a skinny family, and did not find overweight attractive), I wanted to and date her for who she was. This was the problem that came to rear its ugly head.\\n\\nThe relationship went well for a couple of months, until we tried to escalate into a sexual relationship. While I found her pretty, and cute even, I did not find her sexy. This became very apparent on a physical level, as I was unable to maintain an erection due to her figure. This led to a lot of hard feelings between us, both feeling incompetent for the other.\\n\\nI did offer to work with her; I invited her to my workouts, I offered to diet with her, etc. However, she laid the blame on me, trying to get me to change my perspective on sexuality/what I found attractive. This weathered away at our relationship for a few months before it ended, leaving us both feeling uneasy/angry. I will admit, I did try only a little to change my perspective on the matter, and unsuccessfully at that.\\n\\nAnd for the meat of it. On the last day, in my home (we did live apart), she laid out an ultimatum that I need to be finding her attractive within 2 months, or she was leaving me. I confronted her angrily about it, saying I can\\'t change it, and told her to leave. She refused, and I wound up bodily bringing her to the door and locking her out of the house, as I told myself I was unwilling to live with ultimatums that I saw as avoidable/impossible/non-negotiable. Even though she knocked for a time, and offered to go back on her statement, I refused to go and let her in anymore.\\n\\n   For the final prompt. AITA for:\\n\\n1) Entering a relationship knowing I did not find the other attractive \\n\\n2) Not attempting therapy for myself to change my sexual perspective/desires\\n\\n3) Taking a final stance and enforcing it physically\\n\\n4) Refusing to allow her to withdraw the ultimatum and working it out\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSorry again if this falls under the \"stop posting general relationship stuff\" category. I understand if this is unwanted.', 'b83t3a': '[removed]', 'b83tgo': \"I'm the manager of a barbershop/salon. We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \\n\\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\\n\\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \\n\\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\\n\\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get.

I absolutely love my work as a choir director for these kids, and I really do enjoy hearing them sing. \\n\\nI am in the beginning stages of planning my wedding, and a question came up concerning the music during the ceremony. I had the idea to ask my little cherub choir to sing, and my fiancee loved the idea, as she knows how dear those kids' voices are to me, and how much they would enjoy being there for the ceremony, if only as the musicians. \\n\\nI mentioned this idea to the kids at our last rehearsal, and they were all very excited. A few mentioned to me that it made them feel like 'real musicians', to do a wedding gig. I pitched this idea to the parents of the choir, and the majority seem pretty okay with it. However, a few felt jilted, when I explained that the parents and children would not be guests at the ceremony, nor at the reception. The ceremony will only be attended by our immediate family at whatever venue we choose, and the parents would be able to either drop off their kids for the duration of the ceremony, or wait it out in seating in another area. The reception will take place hours later, likely in my own backyard, and there will not be anyone invited that is under the age of 21, for a variety of reasons, the least of which is the presence of alcohol. \\n\\nThe kids are old enough and experienced enough to behave themselves for the duration of the ceremony, and most of the parents (including those few that are complaining) do not attend most of the church services nor other events the kids sing at, so I don't see how this is any different. And again, most of the parents seem fine with it. \\n\\nI told the parents who were frustrated that if they didn't like not being guests, then their kids wouldn't have to sing, and they could just skip the event- 10/12 singers would work just as well.

This trip was in the works for half a year and I worked the budget (hotel, restaurants, gas, ect) to where I didn’t feel too guilty taking this vacation. \\n\\nMy wife mentioned she wanted to stop by somewhere to get a souvenir for the trip. No problem, we were over-budget but something small would be fine. She had me drive to a popular local-brand store and wanted to buy a $115 hooded sweatshirt. I basically vetoed the purchase saying it was too expensive. I asked her if she could find something she wanted for closer to $50 (still about $25 more than I was thinking) but she wasn’t a fan of the lower-priced items and complained they didn’t have anything she liked in medium other than the $115 shirt. \\n\\nIt didn't seem to bother her too much, but on the drive home (3 hours) she was very quiet with the occasional comment about how she was still thinking about the hoodie. I felt super guilty about spending money on this vacation and telling my wife she couldn't have the one thing she asked for. At the same time, I just felt $115 was way too much money to spend on a sweatshirt with a popular brand name.\\n\\nFor perspective, I spent about $400 total on hotel, game tickets, meals and other expenses. We’re only about to save $150 a month or so with bills and such.

She's in her 40s and has never had success in her career. It's not entirely her fault, but she takes it out on other people. I'm younger and things have gone better for me, but she thinks that I can help her in ways that I can't. Years ago I hired a woman (my intern) into a full-time job. My sister was **furious** over this and said I should have given her the job. My sister wasn't qualified for it, my intern had a relevant Masters degree, and my sister lived 3000 miles away. Years after that, I left that job and began dating my former co-worker. We're still dating.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n(My sister and I have talked about that job, and once she seemed to understand and accept that it was the right decision.)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nLast July my sis &amp; nephew came to visit. My nephew is among my favorite people in the world and we play all kinds of games every time we're together. The first few days went OK. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOne afternoon we were on a pier dancing to a jazz band and having a good time. My GF joined us, and as soon as she showed up my sister shut down. She didn't say hi to her, didn't acknowledge her presence, just looked straight through her. We walked 10 minutes to a restaurant and she wouldn't say a thing to her the whole time. In the restaurant my GF was seated immediately across from her. My sister still wouldn't acknowledge her. My GF felt so awkward and insulted that she made up an excuse and left. (My GF &amp; my sis have met a few times before w/o incident.)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI was livid. After my nephew went to bed I told my sister how angry I was. She said I that I had no empathy for her and said that my GF would never get an apology. She left town a couple days later (earlier than planned) and we haven't spoken since. That was 9 months ago.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis past week included the bdays of my sis and nephew. I sent him a note and a gift and I included a short letter to my sister saying that I wanted her to be a part of my life, and that I hoped we could treat the people in both of our lives with respect. I didn't call my nephew though, bc I didn't want to go through my sister. This is the first time I haven't spoken to him on his bday. My sister never responded to the letter, and that was 2 weeks ago. (I sent the gift early.)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe day after my nephew's bday I learned (from my dad) that my sister needed $150 to take her dog to the vet. I sent my dad $300 and told him to give it to my sis.

My girlfriend is currently saddled with over $15,000 in *her mother\\'s debt* that was put in credit cards/student loans under my girlfriend\\'s name, and she is intent to get a second job just to help pay off debt that isn\\'t hers.\\n\\nApparently, my girlfriend started borrowing her mother money at 16 as things at the household were tight, but under the table payments in cash, which certainly isn\\'t counted in that first total, eventually turned into credit cards after her mom maxed out her own and tanked her credit score.\\n\\nMy future MIL has consistently said that she would pay these back, and took out loans that she promised would be applied to the debt. However, she instead used these loans to pay for vehicles, a tummy-tuck, and trips. For one of these loans, my girlfriend took a lean out on *her own vehicle* as collateral for the loan.\\n\\nI recently broke when two separate events compounded to give me the impression that this woman will never pay my girlfriend back. The first of these events took place back in December when, as legal guardian of my girlfriend\\'s twin half-siblings, took money from their savings accounts to pay down debt. This money had been given to them by their father to set up college funds and they had no knowledge of the withdrawal. They are 13 years old and certainly do not track those accounts.\\n\\nThe second incident, and the tipping point, occurred last week. My girlfriend pays her family\\'s general expenses for the month and is then repaid when her mom gets her paycheck. She lives at home (for the moment) and thinks this is fine as she has never had much of an issue in being repaid. Her mother has now missed 2 payments and this week came to her asking for an extra $600 to pay the water bill which is apparently overdue by multiple months.\\n\\nShe called asking me what to do and I said to refuse to pay it. She has her own expenses and it is too large of a financial strain to deal with. Her mother and her got in a shouting match that had a lot of, \"You live under my roof!\" from my understanding. The two are now at odds, and I am in the middle of it.\\n\\nWhen I came over to go on a weekend getaway, I told her mother that if my girlfriend paid off a single one of her credit cards, she would never see her grandchildren. She then went on a tirade about how horrible that was, and that I was brainwashing her daughter into hating her family. She has since spread rumors to all of her children and other family members about how terrible and manipulative I have been.

In a month he wants to leave his day job and start his real estate enterprise, which would involve finding apartments, buying them, finishing them up himself (or renovating) and either selling them for a higher price or furnishing them and renting their rooms. I\\'m no expert in it but he does seem to know his thing and, from what my wife tells me, David and David\\'s wife are quite the venturesome types. Even though they have two small kids, they also started a small side-business a few years ago (while also working full-time jobs) which they intend to sell in a year or two to focus on real estate. David is looking for investors, since he doesn\\'t yet have the financial capacity to buy multiple apartments himself and really kick it off.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAfter hearing this, I reached out to an old friend of mine, let\\'s call him George.

He\\'s been a good friend of mine but we don\\'t live in close vicinity so nowadays we see each other 2-3 times a year and speak too little on the phone for me not to have a guilty conscious about it. Anyway, during the past few years, he also started to invest in real estate but doesn\\'t know our local market. He invests mostly abroad and if it\\'s local, he lives in a completely different part of the country anyway so he focuses on his operations there.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBoth gentlemen seemed very keen in talking to each other. If not to strike a deal then at least to exchange experiences. George is starting very slowly, since he\\'s currently got his main business to run and David wants to go all in within the next few months but is only on his first investment now. So, they\\'re both learning their new trade. Therefore, I connected them - exchanging their email addresses and phone numbers.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI did mention to David that if they strike a deal, I\\'ll probably be wanting a small cut, like 1000 USD.

We have 2 other kids in the house, both of whom are pretty demanding due to being on the spectrum/mental health issues. We have a stable income and live in a well to do middle class area with good schools etc. My SO and I always discussed having 1 more child, especially one close in age to our youngest who is almost 3. Our 3yo is suspected to be on the spectrum but diagnosis pending until she’s a bit older. I have been unable to work for the past year due to severe depression and chronic anxiety.

Disclaimer and important fact, we aren’t in a committed relationship so if I actually WANTED to hook up with someone else I could, and I would not be inclined to tell him or even feel bad about it. However I did feel so so bad about that night. I cried to him upon returning home and mostly just said I felt like my life was falling apart. Why was it really falling apart though? He was very suspicious and I lied to him saying I didn’t hook up with anyone sexually and no one raped me. I felt like I wasn’t lying because 1.) a penis did not rape me and 2.) I did not hook up with anyone sexually, someone USED and VIOLATED me and it was not consensual. Something in me could not take responsibility. At that point, it felt like it didn’t even happen to me. I genuinely could not tell him, I feel like I didn’t process it myself considering he began to question me just hours after it happened. \\nI lied to him without a thought. \\n\\nNOW, two weeks later I came out with the truth about it to him.

This lead to a big verbal fight between him and my parents for several days. However, my parents (especially mom) were also mad at me because I mostly refused to get involved in \"family matters\".

Initially he seemed ok, we asked him questions about college, jobs, just normal future questions you’d ask say a teacher.\\n\\nWell fasts forward my friend began speaking to him more and it went from school to flirting. I was pretty weirded out but figured, hey it’s a grown man, she probably says they’re flirting but it’s not and I told her to be careful. Well they got together a few months before she turned legal.\\n\\nI had a lot of red flags going off in my head. And I warned her again but again I never got directly involved for months when their relationship began. I was only there when she complained and talked about him. From what she told me he had gotten out of a long committed relationship a while back ago, he convinced her to start drinking, smoking, having sex, which in itself isn’t totally bad if you’re doing it safe because let’s be honest, high schoolers are curious dumb shits. But what worried me was that in all the time I’ve known her, she had constantly told us her faith won’t let her and that she’s loyal to her God and would never betray her parents who I’m not gonna lie, were pretty damn strict. She threw that out the window pretty quickly.\\n\\nShe would take him with her whenever we hung out. It was weird that a grown man was hanging out with high school girls even if he was claiming he was trying to get to know his girlfriend’s friends better. At this point I had tried to subtlety tell her that I didn’t trust him, or how it was strange he couldn’t even wait until she turned legal, when she brought up problems she had with him or the wild behavior she began exhibiting. I never ever said anything while she gushed about him and I didn’t know she had been relaying my words to him every time I said something until finally she told one of our mutual friends that she and her boyfriend thought I needed to get my head out of my ass and not be so jealous over their relationship and stop being delusional. There were also a few more hurtful choice words said to me that I rather not repeat. I told them then and there that I refused to speak to her and him and stand by my statement that it’s fucking weird they’re dating.\\n\\nIt’s been a couple of years since then, haven’t spoken to her at all but we’re still in the same friend group. They’re still together, a little bit on and off. My friends and I recently agreed to meet on a certain date and because our schedules are so busy, it’s really rare that we all get together. However she wants to come and bring her boyfriend too and I told my friends I was still uncomfortable and possibly not attend if she’s there with him. Not to mention while a larger chunk of my conscious agrees their relationship is really weird, another part of me is beginning to doubt if I was wrong about him since they’re still together after so long. My friends are begging me to come saying I can just avoid him and that they’ve changed but honestly after the horrible things they both said about me not even to my face with no apology and the fact that they don’t think anything was wrong with him pursuing a 17 year old when he was almost 30, I don’t want to bless them with my presence or even text them. Friends might not be calling me an asshole to my face but I can tell some of them are disappointed in me.\\n\\nSo AITA for not wanting to even give them, especially him, a chance and possibly miss the one chance my friends and I get to gather?', 'b8534k': 'To start off, I’m 18 I have a 4 year old son. Also I’m on mobile so excuse any mistakes please. My parents have been heroin addicts since I was 9. So little did I know but that was the last year I’d be able to only worry about myself.\\n\\n  Okay, so my family moved 3 hours away from our hometown, back to the house where it all started (the drug abuse, that is) and things went great for months. Until last month. My dad slipped up, which led to my mom slipping up too. So every morning when they leave I get frustrated bc They say they will be back shortly. It’s always shortly. So I could be sitting here for 5 minutes or 2 hours waiting for them to get back. Well, this morning everyone was out of cigarettes and they left without saying anything. So I called and asked when they’d be back. Can you guess what the answer was? Yeah, Shortly. Fair enough. I made a pot of coffee, checked on my son, and sat down at the kitchen table to waste time until they get back. After 45 minutes I call again asking when exactly “shortly” will be and they say they don’t know. I ask if they have any half cigs or anything in their room and they say no, alright I sighed and said okay. Then my dad jumps all over me for my “attitude”. Which really upset me because generally my dad does not snap at me or yell at me so I started crying bc I really didn’t mean to sound snappy or anything. I was just getting irritated at not having my morning cig yet. \\n\\n  So, my dad comes home and after they’re done doing their thing he tells me to come here and says I need to stop snapping at him when my morning doesn’t go “perfectly”. Now, I’ll admit I can totally be a bitch in the morning. It’s been a problem for a while, but since getting on antidepressants and trying to manage my feelings it’s much less of an issue. So thismade me feel worse because I’ve really been trying to just do my thing in the morning and try to not be a mega Bitch. But then he goes off on a tangent about how after “one slip up” we kids write him off and distance ourselves. This “slip up” has been going on for over a month now. I listed off every thing I had to go through in the last 10 years that stemmed from their drug use and not being able to care for us. I told him how every other “slip up” ends up with him or them both in jail or on the streets. I guess now I’m kinda starting to ramble, but am I the asshole for sometimes getting an attitude regarding their “slip ups” and distancing myself from them when they happen?? I’m moving into my own apartment with my son within the month. But if they get strung out and lose the house I’ll have my son, and 2 teenage brothers to care for.  I don’t want to have to be responsible for my brothers, but I also don’t want them to end up in foster care. \\n\\nTL;DR: my parents are heroin addicts and get mad when I get an attitude regarding their habits and the fact that if this “slip up” continues and they get strung out I’ll have not only my son to care for but also my 2 teen brothers. ', 'b853wk': \"Please read. Sorry for my English, length  and format. Here we go: my BFF (f) decided to help one of her friends (M) and to let her move into her flat. So far, so good, but I don't want it. I'm worried because, well.... M is a fucking train wreck. Let me explain: l already feel like a complete cunt to say this because things were never good into M's home (her family is a disaster) and seeing this l can just say that I can understand why she acts the way she act but..... Let me give some examples. She totally lack common sense. \\nShe doesn't understand money. If she has some cash she will just waste it on useless stuff (she bought a dog without even having a house) and complain because she doesn't have it anymore and she is poor. \\nShe has very bad higyen issues. Due to her family life she used to live in total squalor, and she is incapable of tell filthy from clean :in her old house she NEVER changed her sheets, picked up her dog's crap ,  washed anything and seldom changed her clothes ( her reasoning: they aren't stained, so they are clean); while I'm sorry for this, I'm concerned for my friend: her health is pretty frail, and she is often ill, plus she is a very tidy person. And these are the smallest things. \\nIf  there is a poster girl of too dumb to live, that's M. She doesn't understand that crossing the road without watching is dangerous just like she doesn't understand that unprotected sex leads to pregnancies: she already has had two abortions (I'm not against it, just.... Why when you could use condoms and avoid stds?????) and still asks us if having sex while standing on top can lead to a pregnancy or if you can get pregnant giving a bj.  Until now,  you can think of her like a sad tragic Kevina, but the real issue are her acquaintances: she is a bad people magnet. Robbers, junkies, drug dealers are her friends, and she will bring them with her if you let her move into your house.  two of my friends have let her in: they houses have been robbed, damaged or used as a brothel  ( ah, M was being pimped by her boyfriend. She said that since she was his gf it wasn't pimping). They even found two  needles. She also gave to her friends the keys of the houses without consulting my friends first (both the times).  they were forced to change their locks, and received anonymous death threats for this, and one of them was also punched in the face by one of M's friends that did not want to leave. She still couldn't understand why they kicked her out, since she wasn't the one that did drugs or stole. The point is: I'm sure M will just die or be sold as a sex slave or something if someone doesn't help her, but I'm terrified that something could happen to F.

I have been in fairly decent shape throughout our friendship, but have gained about 15 pounds in the past couple years. It kind of crept up on me and I didn’t realize it until a few months ago, when I weighed myself with the scale in her bathroom on a whim (I don’t own one). I was shocked at the number and told her about it. I immediately took steps to eat healthier, joined a gym, and started walking on my lunch- and 15-minute breaks at work (I have a sedentary office job). \\n\\n&amp;nbsp; \\n\\nI’ve mentioned these lifestyle changes here and there (for example: she called me while I was driving and I answered on speakerphone; she asked where I was going and I said the gym. Or we had a conversation about developing healthy hobbies and I told her exercise is becoming a habit for me, but not a hobby yet). My friend confided in me she was feeling bad about herself because of how much weight she’s gained, so I offered to bring her to the gym with me. She declined (for legitimate reasons: she has a foot condition that makes even walking painful, and my gym doesn’t have a pool). I’ve been cooking a lot and have invited her over to share some healthy meals with me. (I didn’t put it that way, I just invited her over for a meal or offered her food when we were hanging out, and I don’t make unhealthy food anymore.)\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nI still don’t own a scale and there isn’t one at my gym. I think it’s better to focus on being healthy and not obsess about the numbers, so I have decided not to buy one. I’ve been over her house several times since this lifestyle change and chose not to weigh myself. But last night I gave into temptation and weighed myself on her scale. I was excited to see I’ve lost four pounds! I shared the good news with her and she seemed happy for me. After a fair amount of drinking, she got really upset at our other friend for paying more attention to “the cute skinny girl” than her and had a bit of a meltdown. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp; \\n\\nI talked it out with her and she told me it’s upsetting to hear me talk about weight gain when I’m so much smaller than her.

I think it is positively insane for anyone to expect me to go on 5 dates with a guy and then immediately assume the role of stepmom to his kid-- who, again, already has a perfectly capable, loving mother. And I also think it's insane for anyone to expect him to break up with a girl who already took a leap of faith to date a Father just because she isn't immediately ready, at age 23, to take on the lifelong commitment of being a stepparent.\\n\\nIf we'd been dating for 5 years, or were planning on getting engaged, or something- I would feel way differently. I love babies and kids and think stepfamilies can absolutely work and be beautiful. But I'm 23, the relationship is brand new, and I feel like the expectations for my boyfriend and I are way too high- and he agrees.

We agree on a rate for the increase in utilities, and Dale moves in with the dogs.It is noteworthy here that Nancy works contract positions all around the country. Generally, Dale will stay home while Nancy does this. In this new arrangement, Dale will continue to live here for the newly negotiated rate when Nancy leaves to do her next contract.\\n\\nNancy has some trouble with her car, I help to fix it, but she insists on taking it to the dealer instead. For three weeks I help Nancy out with rides to work, its a minor inconvenience but it works with my schedule so its not that big of a deal. For the last week, my wife and I suggest that they borrow our third car that we have been trying to fix up and sell. Its a great car, just has some oil pressure problems we\\'ve been working on diagnosing, so I make sure Dale knows what to do. They get the car back, and we ask them if they want to buy our car for about a third of KBB. It\\'s taking up space and costs of insurance so we want to get rid of it. They indicate they do. From this point forward, Dale borrows our car frequently to run errands. They haven\\'t made any downpayment and we still pay the insurance for it.\\n\\n2 months later, we ask them if they are still serious because we are considering selling it. They say they are, but they don\\'t have the money, and tell us to \"do what we need to do.\"\\n\\nWe decide to list it on Craigslist, this was 4 days later. I ask Dale for the keys and tell him we are selling it. They are surprised. Nancy is upset and tells us that she thought the plan was that she was going to title it in her name, pay insurance, and make payments to us. I didn\\'t know this, but she had a conversation with my wife where Nancy suggested this plan and my wife told her \"We can talk about it.\" Needless to say, we don\\'t like Nancy\\'s plan, and indicate that we would rather just sell the car, payment in full, and be done with it.\\n\\nNancy then tells us that Dale and the dogs will need to move out when she goes to her next gig because the arrangement was contingent upon us furnishing a vehicle for him to drive while he stays with us, since they were going to buy our car. Additionally, he needs this vehicle because they have a dog with a serious medical condition and he needs to be able to take this dog to the vet. I was unaware that the terms of their tenancy were dependent on us providing him with a vehicle, and personally I feel manipulated.

I decided to watch the last 45 minutes of the movie and I have to say it was pretty good. When I told her I finished the movie she seemed pretty upset, we didn’t fight or anything and there was no yelling or tears involved but she still looked pretty upset.

Because of how the room is set up, in order to avoid the light, anybody in bed would have to turn over to face the wall. I kept my lamp on for light as I got dressed, got ready to go, and then turned off my lamp and left the room. My light was on for maybe 20- 30 mins total. \\n\\nWhen I got back from class, both of roommate were gone. When one of them came back, they said ‘Hey, can you not turn on your lamp in the morning anymore? It wakes me up every time and I can’t fall back asleep.’ Normally, I would completely understand and apologize, and work to find another solution. However, this roommate consistently keeps their lamp on their desk on until 3am, keeping my other roommate and I awake. \\n\\nI told her that I need the light for getting dressed and for getting ready at my desk, and she said ‘you have a flashlight on your phone, just use that!’. She kept talking over me when I was trying to tell her that I didn’t think that was going to work, so finally I said that I would try it the next time I had class, but wasn’t going to guarantee anything. She then said maybe I could look into getting a dimmer lamp instead of the one provided for us by the school in the dorms.  \\n\\nThis roommate isn’t very considerate of either of us that live in this room (giggling until 2am, when all of the lights are off and we are both clearly trying to sleep, refusing to take out the trash, etc), and we have done a lot to accommodate her sleeping schedule.

I also want to add that he lives with me, in an apartment my mother pays for since I'm in college. No job. No drive to get one. Barely helps with housework and I cook dinner. My mom even offered to send him to school with me to get some type of degree.\\n\\nA year ago, I was going to end it after the last time I caught him. I agreed to stick it out, once again due to him guilting me into trying to forgive him, which was a mistake. Though, that I know of, he isn't talking to anybody. I left last weekend because I couldn't take it anymore and now he's realizing everything he should've been doing and trying to get me back. But the thing is, I'm mentally and emotionally done.

I can't even have friends because he's convinced no matter if it's a dude or a chick, they're out to try and diddle me. The last good friends I made, he forced to just cut them out.\\n\\nThe last straw was from him snapping back at me over a video game.

She said that I clearly hadn\\'t learned from last year and that I was being selfish. \\n\\nI gave it some thought and I think she is partially right - I am being selfish in wanting to spend 2-3 days with just my friends and not considering how flying alone is scary for her. \\n\\nWhat I am hung up on is that I never get to see these friends and this is the only time I get to hang out with them.

We're extremely close and he's basically a brother. He grew up with a hard life. He had a single mother who has mental issues where she treats him horribly. She used to leave him alone so often that he joined the Bloods and was even shot at one point before he was 10 years old. Eventually he was taken away from her in his early teens and moved in with my dad's brother. He was the bad apple of the family from there on out. He used to take a lot of drugs, sell drugs, steal from houses and family, fight etc. Most of my family stopped associating with him after he was 18 because he stole from family.\\n\\nAround that age I was interested in smoking weed so we connected at some point and became pretty close doing things we're not supposed to. There were times where he went to jail and I'd help him three-way his mom or son (he was never okay with being deadbeat). He would help me out by giving me things, giving me advice, generally being supportive - it was in no way a one sided relationship. Eventually he ended up going to prison for 2 years and lost everything. Since he's gotten out we've only gotten closer and instead of an enabling type friendship - we've started encouraging each other to be better people. He talks about how he regrets how he was when he was younger all the time and that the culture shock of coming from a broken home was a big factor.\\n\\n**Summary:** While he continually fucks up - I do genuinely believe he wants to turn his life around. The issue is that he wants to turn his life around HIS way. He still has a street mentality (ex. he loves posting pictures of his money, still claims Blood and says it's impossible for him not to be, he always seems to find the crowd that's up to no good). He says he's saving to enroll in cooking school (this is true), but hustling in the meantime.\\n\\nTBH I'm pretty tired of being emotionally invested in him turning things around if he's still going to be stupid in so many ways. After his last FB posts making blatant references to illegal activity &amp; gang affiliation - I just randomly blocked him. Now he's texting me asking why he's blocked and how dare I block him without having talked about things. We've talked about it multiple times and he continues to do things that could get him in trouble.

About 6 months after I came out my parents went to a conference for parents of LGBT children and after that have been going to therapy about once a month. I started going to the same therapist with them a little after a year since coming out and it has been very helpful to me. \\n\\nHowever, when me and my dad are in therapy together or have discussions I always find him domineering the conversation and not listening. I know he wants to change and is trying to fix it but after over 2 years of therapy and discussions he is more respectful  when I stop him to express how I feel, but unless I very directly interrupt him he will keep talking and when I talk he is usally focused on developing his response instead of actively listening. He is aware of this and I have called him out repeatedly.\\n\\nBackground on our personalities. \\n\\nMy dad is an entrepreneur and very authoritative and talks in statements. If you know of the emmegram test he is an Eight. He has lived in a fairly like minded and conservative Christian suburb where he and my my raised me, and when we talk he expresses that he want to have a better relationship and ability to communicate but does not want to change his other views and friends. (I do not ask him to change his views or friends but they do come up as points of contention often). I know he loves me and has been a good dad in many aspects. However he is very business oriented as a entrepreneur, most times and memories of his are interrupted by him being on a phone call or focused on money. Most discussions tend to sway towards mechanical issues at work, money, or business ideas. It is where he is comfortable talking and I resent it as I feel he has put his business and money ahead of being there for me and our family and because of that he stays I  his comfort zone and did not grow in his views or personally and let himself be surrounded in the conservative Christian bubble that was very close minded and unintentionally emotionally stunted me and hurt me. \\n\\nI am more introverted and struggled alot to come out as I am a people pleaser and always strived to do and be what was expected from me. On the emmagam scale I am a five. I recently graduated university, am working full time, and live on my own downtown. Despite being raised with negative and hurtful experiences in a conservative Christian suburb, I am still good in my faith and view it as more personal, as in not needing to go to a church. I still have alot of emotional and romantic issues due to my upbringing.\\n\\nAll that said, I find myself very resentful and irritated when me and my dad talk as whenever we work on communication or have discussions and I call him out on a behavior that stifles our conversation or something that bothers me he takes the defensive and always says it is just how he is and he doesn't know how to be different but he is trying. However he only seems to focused on our relationship if it is directly in front of him and when I vent my frustrations to my mom or sister they always remind me he is trying his best and it is hard for him to change and unintentionally invalidate my feelings. I feel that I am being unfair to my dad but I cannot get past the resentment and irritation that bubbles up I  me and I do not know if that irritation is unfounded and I am being an asshole as my parents are paying for therapy and going out of their way to actively mend our relationship and communication habits.\\n\\nTDLS My dad try's his best to better our relationship but I am still resentful that he doesn't understand me.\", 'b87mmt': 'Yes, this is serious. My friends think I’m an asshole for giving my money to Chick-fil-A. ', 'b87muh': 'Mobile warning and I’m an idiot when it comes to spelling so warning? Lmao\\n\\nSo I’m in this project a GIANT project that’s (USA) nation wide and I was elected team captain. I always had a ton of pressure on my shoulders trying to make this as perfect as possible. I want my team to win!\\nI’m pushing through this but in every single situation where something happens or something goes wrong I’ve been made out to always be the bad guy. It’s getting really close to our deadline and there’s a big part we still haven’t finished. Everyone we’ve gotten to help us has either not responded or ditched last minute and as I said it’s very close (4 days) to being due. My bff volunteered her parent to help us do it and though I’m skeptical about it, I’m going along with it because we need to get this done. Though I’m going along with her parent helping, I’ve been made into the bad guy again just because I don’t have the ultimate trust in this guy I’ve meet like four Times. So now she’s all offended that I don’t trust him as much as she does. Yea he’s had practice making blueprints for hangars but I think that’s a little different than designing a full on restaurant. Maybe a little bit? I’m so happy he’s helping us with it but is it really bad for not being fully confident? \\n\\nI’m tired of being seen as the bad guy in this project and I’m always tempted to just give up but I seriously can’t. Is there any advice y’all can give me. I’m really struggling at the moment.', 'b87nyh': 'Recently I have agreed to take care of a dog that was abandoned by her previous owners for unknown reasons. She\\'s still pretty young, barely above a year old, displaying puppy-like behaviours.\\n\\nShe\\'s very cute looking, she has those eyes like that cat from Shrek - you just can\\'t refuse her anything when she looks at you with them. She makes a fantastic impression on anyone who meets her and usual reaction is \"oh, she\\'s so sweet, what a lovely dog\".\\n\\nThe only thing is, she\\'s not.\\n\\nShe\\'s a huge attention seeker - whenever you\\'re in the house, she\\'ll keep following you like a lost puppy (maybe cuz she is one) and she constantly wants to be peted. But when you leave the house, she becomes an unstoppable destructive force with one objective - to ruin your entire apartment. \\n\\nOkay - when I agreed to take her, no one warned she\\'s like that. But I took into consideration that foster dogs are not a fairy tale and that she might be problematic. I took her 1,5 month ago and since then, she already costed me over 2,5k euro (she destroyed the tv, my clothes, some of the furniture, headphones and some other less valuable of my stuff). I was furious when I found out that she destroyed the TV, but I never vented out on her.\\n\\nI understand that she\\'s not doing this on purpose and most likely it\\'s separation anxiety, but all those events made simply not like her. When I look at her, I don\\'t see an adorable dog, I see someone who ruined tons of my stuff. I really, really don\\'t like her.\\n\\nNow don\\'t get me wrong - I\\'m not abusing her or anything. I still take care of her and I\\'m giving her attention, although it\\'s forced from my side - I don\\'t want to give her back until she\\'ll find a permanent home. Despite the fact that I\\'m caring for her as much as I can (I recently taught her how to give paw and how to sit), people still call me an asshole or an idiot when I\\'m telling them that I don\\'t like her due to the fact that she\\'s not my dog and never will be and that she destroyed lots of my stuff. I\\'m not forced to like a dog - I still take care of her and make sure that she has everything she needs and I\\'m doing my best to correct her behaviour, but that doesn\\'t mean I have any positive feelings about her.\\n\\nYet people still call me an asshole for that - am I really one for not liking someone who devastated my place? ', 'b87o4q': \" \\n\\nOkay I know the title paints me as the asshole immediately. So context,\\n\\nme and my friends were all joking about our relatives names and our own names etc, I don't know how to explain it, we were not seeing people as inferior for their names just laughing about how names are and sound.\\n\\nSo, first of all, me and my ex are on great terms. We both are friends today and have no hard feelings, I had a pretty decent relationship with her father (before he passed), her family and all that, it just didn't work out.\\n\\nSo my friends and I are sitting there and making fun of names and then I said that her fathers name sounded a little silly, and my friends went quiet and said that I should just stop.\\n\\nI defended myself saying it's not a big deal and, eventually I got a little frustrated and said that I'm just humanizing a person who is gone, and that you should be able to joke about anything and everything. Eventually one of my friends said that it maybe wasn't that bad but some of our friends perhaps doesn't like to joke about everything.\\n\\nI felt terrible, because how my friends reacted and that I may have been a total asshole. So, am I the asshole?\"}\n"

I showed his parents the exercises and they said that even just going to PT is a waste of time. Needless to say, they haven't done any of the exercises. They refuse to do tummy time because they think it's bs. Our pediatrician even recommended a special juice for her as her digestive cycle is a little backed up.

He was bedridden the entire time and we had to clean him because he was unable to do so for himself, which I know hurt his pride, but I didn't mind being there for him.

What we usually do is that while someone is driving the other one smokes but today i got too high therefore i was not able to drive, so i told him and he was telling that i was being selfish for not letting him smoke, but then i convinced him of driving me to a place where i would feel safe and familiar so he did. When we got there i started driving to our destination(which was not far, it was less than 2-3 miles) and he started smoking. Halfway to where we were going i told him that we should stop and rest as i saw that he was really high and i was really fucking high. He then started saying that he was not high and that if i would not drive he would drive but we were both stoned. I then call my other brother and he came and got us out of there. Was i the asshole for getting really high, not wanting to drive and believing that my brother was high so i did not let him drive?
